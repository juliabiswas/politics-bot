"I would like to congratulate the right to lifers. Trump won in large part because of Christian conservatives who can't seem to wrap their pious little heads around anything besides fetuses. Yes, your guy won and he's going to jam your version of morality down our throats if it kills us all! It might come as a shock to you, though, that famine, flooding and water wars will not spare the little pre-darlings you claim to revere.In your zeal to save cells, you might have doomed humanity. Discuss that at your celebratory barbeque tomorrow."I hope the Conman-in-Chief's golf courses have salt-resistant grass."If if all you have is a hammer and you're Donald Trump, everything looks like a Ming vase."Enough. Time for some divine intervention. Hope he keeps eating all the junk food."Stupid, reckless, careless, disastrous, dark, explosive, irresponsible, travesty, thoughtless, small, narrow, thin, foolish, idiotic, short sided, wasteful, catastrophic, ignorant, retrograde, immoral, warped, disingenuous ...... What is Donald Trump. Please feel free to add more to the list."Mr. Trump is a fraud full of hot air."Trump is on self-destruct and like a suicide bomber he wants to take everyone down with him.If he was floating away on an iceberg dislodged from the Antarctica shelf, he would yell that it was all the fault of the Democrats.""Trump, Pence and Bannon are criminals against all of humankind.

There are BILLIONS to be made in clean energy and we could be on the forefront, but they keep clinging to fossil fuels. Hopefully they will go the way of the dinosaur that made the petro-chemicals and we can get back into the Paris agreements."Donald Trump certainly has given the Koch brothers their money's worth. The only people to profit from this debacle are the Kochs. Workers will get almost nothing but health problems they will have to pay for down the road. America gets a middle finger from another angry old white man . . ."As usual NY Times (and Mr. Bill McBirren in particular) shows its carelessness to American people and to their own country. Everyone knows that Paris act is much more about greed of European leaders than it is about climate change. Climate change itself is quite questionable. To understand the situation one must be at least literate in math and physics. I understand that it is too much to ask from so called ""scientists"" who filled our universities and contaminated them with arrogance and partisan ideas rooted not in facts but in huge side payments from so called ""Democrats"". Unfortunately these so called ""scientists"" brainwashed our young generation in the same way that their German colleagues did for their 75 years ago in German universities. History repeats itself ..... Hopefully NY Times will cease to exist soon. People will understand that there is much more information in toilet paper than in NY Times."A ship of fools has sailed."On Science:a) His ""supporters"" do not mind getting out of an announced (fake-news) tornado or hurricane path. Why not be macho like their leader, hunker down, and take one on the chin for the skipper.b) Taking a page out of the NRA playbook, stop all investigative sciences whether on killing by high-velocity bullets or killing by high-velocity droplets. That way the peanut gallery will not spend some much time being so argumentative.On the rest:It is always that same illiterate bunch of racists rednecks who rallied behind Goldwater, Wallace, Specter, Helms,,,,, and now Trump. They do not like anybody and they do not even like themselves. They constitute the trough vile Republicans feed themselves from.This time there is going to be a backdraft that is going to engulf them all for good.In summary:The rest of the world is already laughing at us, 4 months into the ordeal.

Why should anyone believe you now when you've never gotten it right? Great job Mr. Trump, keep sticking it in their eye."To leave the agreement and to negotiatiate it again under HIS lead is a narcissist's obsession. Only HE can save the planet. We become victims of an ill mind."We should call Trump's repudiation of the Paris climate accord what it is really all about: his Ego. Trump's approval rating is in the cellar and he believes that a big act of some kind will put him back in control, regardless of the consequences. It is important to Trump to show the world that he's in charge, the world be damned.""Happy, Jill Stein voters?

Trump does not believe it with all the evidence of Global warming therefore it is not happening and who needs the rest of the world anyway.

I haven't really seen the media pursue this angle. Considering that he is the bull in our democratic China Shop, we should at least know who owns the animal. Is it his father? Is it the cronies that laughed at him? Is it those who laughed at his small hands? Is there a simple Freudian answer? I don't know; but, I think it is someone. One of the things that disturbs me most about his administration, if one can really call it that, is that he seems hell-bent on destruction of what better people have built. Meanwhile those who know better stand by and let it happen. This is insanity on a large scale.More to the point: Is it any wonder that the man who declared war on the EPA has managed to pull us out of important global agreements, either by decree or de facto? How can we allow one fool to do so much damage? Doesn't anyone realize that the EPA has done more to protect unborn children, born children, and adults than all the do-gooders of history? Doesn't anyone understand that this one man can destroy more of the global environment than all the misanthropic, megalomaniacal dictators of history?

For a restaurant and beverage guy itâ€™s ALL about optics. So what did we see?A bully who grabbed and pushed people out of the way to get a front row position for a photo!

Macron took charge and squeezed Tweetyâ€™s tiny hand until Trump pulled his whitened knuckles out of Macron's grasp. (â€œI give!â€) Macron didnâ€™t even give him the courtesy of using a translator when he spoke French to Trump, but Macron spoke in English to someone he trusts and likes-Teresa May. The sight of Trump needing to wait for a golf cart to carry his corpulent body down 300 yards of cobblestone street while the other G-7 leaders walked together, talking with each other. SUCH youth and beauty!

But of course, he bursts into the family living room, insisting that he simply MUST demonstrate his skill of playing the Star Spangled Banner while venting rectal gas, and simultaneously belching for dramatic emphasis. While discussing race relations, Donald will declare that he never met a non-white employee he didn't like (exclaiming that they ""love him, and wouldn't DARE steal from HIM because he's such a swell boss). And of course, he's always the first to compliment a woman on the quality of her breast augmentation. In short, on the national, international, or political stage, Donald Drumpf is a living breathing parody of courageous leadership. That is, of course, unless that ""leadership"" is exemplified by how he can utterly disgust, and embarrass every sane and sober American with his enthusiastic incompetence."So what?'Stupid and reckless' was the name of the path that Donald Trump carefully paved and followed to temporarily win the right to occupy the Oval Office of our White House for the next four years. Trump is the one and only currently elected hired senior executive branch head help aka President of United States of our divided limited power democratic American republic. Trump is the Decider-in-Chief. Who are you?"The view of this dreadful decision from Europe is much the same as that articulated by Merkel earlier this week - that the US is now an unreliable factor in world affairs 'led' by a proudly ignorant rich comb-over who would only acknowledge climate change when Mar-a-Lago was half underwater.Just think, this imbecile has lots more time to do even more damage."Trump is an incredibly stupid man. He world IS laughing at you Donald.As the waters close over the glittering towers of Mar -a-Lago....The NYT is the party which is 'stupid and reckless' about climate decisions. Trump is able to see the whole picture and the unworthiness of spending trillions of dollars to achieve a minuscule lessening of carbon emissions."President Bannon has spoken and Trump is his puppet.

This is the best thing Trump has done thus far, and (in spite of the NYTimes' insistence) he's done several good things. Large scale wealth transfers, continued-- indeed, increased-- carbon emissions by developing countries, a negative impact on jobs and the US economy, and a negligible impact on the climate make this treaty a costly, wasteful exercise in futility. No wonder the NYTimes loved it."The Climate Change hysteria is a hoax. Climate Change is a normal part of Earth's history. This is Y2K on steroids.

Even with his daughter and son-in-law asking him not to, the President without a spine or any principles picked the path of least resistance and pandered to his base. OR 2) The art of deflection required him to paint this masterpiece so as to once again take the prying eyes of a nation off Flynn, Jared, Sessions and the rest of his Apple Dumpling Gang. OR 3) His childish ego was bruised at the European G7 play date, so he is taking his treaty ball and going home. OR 4) All of the Above.""I think that Bill McKibben, though well-intentioned, is actually part of the problem. He's not a scientist, an economist, or a policy expert. He's a smart advocate, but also a strident one... he's been a hammer, bludgeoning all those ""stupid"" nonbelievers. Climate policy requires consensus for success, but the McKibben-lead advocates haven't tried very hard to win over skeptics. The attitude has been an arrogant ult-leftish, plowing forward, brute force (as with Obamacare), despite the fact that about half the country disagreed. Critics were ridiculed and silenced; science was exaggerated; and lines were drawn. Well-respected process ideas, such as establishing a Red Team, were rejected out-of-hand. ""Why try to address the skeptics' points when we're right?"" Many of the skeptics are highly respected academic scientists (e.g., Curry, Lindzen, Peikle, Spenser, Christie); they generally don't dispute that greenhouse warming is occurring but question the pace and urgency. So, put together a lack of consensus-building with a climate agreement that is punitive to the U.S. (most developing countries think the U.S. owes them collectively trillions in climate reparations) and guess what's going to happen? The first Republican or populist president elected is going to deep-six the climate policy of the opposition. Why not? They were not consulted or included. As a nation, we have to figure out a better way to make big policies.""What might have been, with no thanks to the so-called ""Green"" Party""https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/climate/"" title=""https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/climate/"" https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/climate/""Please channel your anger and anxiety into the voting boothVote in every election, every time even the ones you think don't matter.""Even if you think that climate change will lead to a climate catastrophe, it is hard to ignore one fact. That is, the solutions proposed will do nothing to avoid catastrophe but will cause a catastrophe of their own. Look at what happened under the Kyoto protocol. The various carbon trading schemes and payments to poor countries did nothing to stem emissions and simply enriched the corrupt. That is what happens in international agreements. They are too political to work. Sure, all these people do things that they claim will help, like Elon Musk making billions off of government subsidies (those who can afford a $100,000+ Tesla Model X get a nice check back from the government -- that really makes sense) and Bill McKibben and his minions blocking the Keystone XL Pipeline for no rational reason. But they are playing politics. The best thing that can happen to reduce carbon dioxide emissions is the march of technology -- things like fracking to make natural gas cheaper and advances in solar and wind electricity generation. But activists do nothing to advance technology, and we learned (or should have learned) long ago that the free market does that job best. Not expensive subsidies that we cannot afford.""Credible science now recognizes climate change, infinitesimal increase in temperature is but a precursor aberration to dramatic climate cooling. Core samples extracted from ice thousands of years old demonstrate this scientific fact. The real concern is earth is entering a significant and alarming cooling phase. The global threat is will civilization be able to survive an extended ice age? Of course, childlike political posturing, politically correct nonsense is irrelevant. There is nothing mankind can do to alter these climate cycles. And everyone already knows this..""It is said that ""Action speaks louder than words."" Trump is not good with words, so he relies on taking action. He pulls the rug out from under us on climate change and any other issue he can think of. Donald Trump sabotages whatever he can get his hands on. So, I hope that the opposition will fully realized how he endlessly works against progress, right now!"Too funny!First obama did not bring the Paris accord to congress to air and debate the details and then vote.Second every single climate agreement and/or democrat policy is this:White majority countries tax themselves into poverty and give the money to non white majority countries that immediately make all the money disappear while achieving nothing. The UN and democrats pat themselves on the back.This was just another stunningly bad deal by obama corrected by President Trump."We need to do everything possible to marginalize this so-called president as quickly as possible. Our goal should be to show the world and his supporters that most of us in the USA do not agree with the small minded, petty, nasty, immoral and stupid actions that he and the lemmings in the Congress promote. RESIST and REPLACE!""Bill McKibben reminds me of Paul Ehrlich in the 1960s and '70s. Always very sure of himself. Always willing to lecture other people and tell them how stupid they are. Always finding an audience eager to hear what he has to say. And always wrong. The fact is, the earth's climate is a very complex, nonlinear system that we do not understand very well. We can make simplified models of it, but as has been noted, all models are wrong (although some are helpful). History has shown us that while keeping carbon dioxide emissions low may help, they do not seem to make much difference. Paul Ehrlich was wrong when he was a Cassandra decades ago. Dead wrong. Millions did not die of starvation. In fact, nothing he said come to pass. Yet if you ask him know, he still says he was right. He just got the timing a little wrong. Bill McKibben too is a false prophet. Those who believe in his preaching (and indeed he is preaching the religion of catastrophic climate change) should realize that he is doing more harm than good. Climate change is an important issue, and it should be addressed. But Bill McKibben is making a mockery of climate science and making fools of his followers. Shame on him and on them.""The more he carries out reckless decisions, the better the chances that the Democrats will capture the House in 2018. Furthermore, has hopefully motivated the independents and the millenniums shift away from the cowardly GOP. He has truly demeaned the presidency and his hard and true base has yet to see through this con-man."Republicans know there is climate change; they just don't want to pay for improving the planet.Let us be clear. Our Senate was purchased by the Koch Bros and the fossil fuel industry. See the Guardian article published 6/1/17 Republican Senators and the Paris Climate Deal. McConnell and his cohort of traitors have sold us out to profit and pollution so that our children and their children will be inundated on the coasts and the Midwest will survive as an island of know nothings ruled by the reigning oligarchy now.I'm baffled by the shock and outrage expressed by American's about this decision. What exactly did people expect when they elected an ignorant buffoon? Did they expect some sort of expert decision making or did they poohpooh it all and think it would never happen. Guess what people. You got what you voted for."To a Climate Doomsday Cultist like Bill McKibben, I'm sure this looks like the apocalypse. But everyone, even the Climate Chicken Littles agreed that the ""Paris Accord"" would do nothing to stem their irrational fears of climate Armageddon. It was, as most leftist things are, purely symbolic. It was their equivalent of the Holy Ghost sweeping through the Apostles. Their symbol is dead, and we will all be better for it.""Trump cancelled the climate agreement in the name of America's national securoty, freedom, democracy, human right, international law and order"Mike Pence and the extremist-right cabal in Washington are behind this decision. They have managed to direct Trump to the far right on many issues The deserve a share of America's contempt for this reckless decision."I recently joined the ""http://350.org"" title=""350.org"" 350.org group. Thanks, Mr McKibben for the cogent statement. I will say that the US WILL meet our volutary contribution to the Paris accords, because WE THE PEOPLE will make sure we do. The main thing that has been lost, and it is a Kremlin dreamscape, is the bonds with our allies, our credibility and leadership in the world, and the respect of people who can read. No company supports this unless it's the Kochs, or some Oklahoma driller who'se got hooks into Pruitt and Imhoff.""Climate change a hoax? Has anyone in Trump's short-sighted, power hungry, racist, sexist, xenophobic, self-aggrandizing, delusional ""cabinet"" (aka The Basket of Deplorables), ever seen glacier calving increasing at alarming swiftness, the flora and fauna moving from EN to CR, to EW to EX? Every day there is some species of plant or wildlife that dies and will never be seen again, due to the devastating effects of climate change, global warming. It's science, and I guess too complex a matter to big men with brains too small to think ""outside the box"" that they think they want America to become. I'm actually glad that I'm old, and will be long gone before the ill effects of this Presidency come to fruition (if they do, heaven help us).""""People say, if all you have is a hammer, then every problem looks like a nail. We should be so lucky. President Trump has a hammer, but all heâ€™ll use it for is to smash things that others have built, as the world looks on in wonder and in fear.""

This is the thought that most frightens me."Trump can claim he is putting coal miners back to work as if any of them want to do that anymore while destroying the planet due to his refusal to read any factual input of the danger of global warming. When Mar a Lago is under water maybe he will believe it ."It's too late anyways.Increasing the population of the planet by 80 million people (eg. population of Germany) each year swamps out any and all attempts to get a handle on not only on climate change, but a myriad of the other side effects of overpopulation.Trump is 70 years old, and doesn't give a damn about anyone. Why should he when 60+ million ignorant incurious suckers voted for him, and 80+ million more too stupid and lazy to vote at all in the face of the extremely obvious existential threat presented in the last election cycle.It takes more than one buffoon to wreck the planet. Millions have to allow it to happen.In a selfish kind of way, I'm glad I'm old. I have pretty much lost respect for this country. I want back the 6 years of my youth I spent in the military defending this god forsaken embarrassment of a country."This was a short-sighted and unfortunate decision that harms the future growth of the U.S. economy. It helps the American Petroleum Industry (in the short-run) by giving a signal that more pollution is OK. But it's a steep price to pay in exchange for bolstering Trump's approval from his core supporters. How much more damage will the nation be forced to endure before 2020?Withdrawing from this will have zero impact on climate. Our emissions are declining and consumers are demanding better cleaner products this will fix itself don't need the treaty. All this talk is just a waste. This is a mere blip on the radar in the history books. People denying climate will look foolish in the future and the people saying the world will end because of climate will look just as foolish. We will adapt and move on.Can someone please tell the conservative's that the only way there going to be able to relive the 50's is with a Flux Capacitor."Judging from the resolve shown by climate-conscious citizens, Trump has just made himself irrelevant. Good! May history show that Americans prevailed despite his incompetence. Let his legacy be a mere anomaly.""There seems to be a hatred emerging in this country towards our current President that is far more personal than the misdirected, cloaked and yet clearly bigoted hatred towards our former President. No one could criticize Barack Obama's personal choices as to his own profile in public or in private - or at least inasmuch as any President can have a private profile. The fact that Obama was so low-key made it difficult for him to be truly appreciated - until he was gone, and the Presidency left in the glaring circus spotlight of a one such as Donald Trump.""Mr. Trump received his college education at the Wharton School of Business. Physics is not taught at that school. Therefore, so far as Donald is concerned, it doesn't exist.

You got my intent even without explicitly swearing as I wanted to."If the Democratic party leaders would kindly wake up, this would make for a nice campaign to reclaim the House and Senate in 2018.

Rio? on and on.Just posturing of world leaders. The real work is never done.Looks good on paper, but.....""Let's get real. Trump is so dumb he still thinks the ""Paris Accord"" is the squeezy instrument used in all those old songs by Edith Piaf.Can you imagine the amount of work it took to get *the entire world* to agree on a developing problem with economic consequences?And Bankruptcy Barbie comes along with her better idea (coal - from the 1810's!!) and smashes it all... for someone else to clean up later, as usual.""Republicans will eventually pay dearly for their blind support of the the man who would be president. Would be because even though winning the electoral vote, the majority of Americans see him as an interloper, whose vanity and stupidity drive his actions. Trump is an anomaly, with no immediate solution. For now, he blindly stumbles on, searching here and there for the solution to his problems. Given his character, he will never succeed because he is learning impaired and childish in his judgment.""Where is Congress? Can't they reverse his order? TRUMPhas pulled out, with a small cadre, but is Congress with himas a majority? I don't get it. Not that many people can beso deeply stupid â€¦and basely cunning.""Dear World, We are really, really sorry about this. It seems as if we're apologizing a lot for our president lately, but we know you understand because you've seen for yourselves recently that he's just not very bright. He's not very nice, either. It's not just you. He doesn't think much about us, either, and neither do his lapdogs in Congress because we don't have much influence these days like their rich friends. Please don't give up on us. Sooner or later we'll get this straightened out. We have to before it's too late. In the meantime, perhaps you'll enjoy spending some time with China. We hear that they've been anxious to get to know you. With love and deep regrets, We the People""Some thoughts DJT would do well to learn and remember.

Your argument is as scientifically solid and as logically constructed as a mathematical theorem. No, these truths are notself evident. As you point out, iit took over 100 years of hard, honest work to establish them. But this fool and the corrupt ignoramuses that follow him think they can be ignored. They may think so but the world knows it can't.""There was a time, not to long ago, when whale oil was prized and the best way to light our homes. Brave Americans went to sea for months and years to bring that precious whale oil home for the country. Now these great people are out of jobs (along with other fine industries like the buggy-whip manufacturers) - put out of work by electricity. Too make America great again, we need to bring back these jobs!Trying to bring back coal mining jobs makes about as much sense as this. Technology changes things, and some industries are made obsolete. I used to work in a CD manufacturing plant. Guess what? Internet music sites just about ended CD manufacturing. That plant closed and I moved on to other work. New technology ends some jobs, but creates as many, or even more jobs. This is an unending cycle that will continue forever into the future as long as we embrace progress and innovation, and not cling nostalgically to the past."Trump views the Paris agreement as a transactional event rather than a strategy for helping the world cope with the global warming crisis. He is only looking at what the United States has to pay in the agreement. But the trade off for withdrawing from the agreement is that the United States utterly abandons leadership on climate change. This is a severe erosion of United States power. The world will increasingly ignore the U.S. and President Trump. He is not making American great again. He is making America irrelevant."While our so-called president is having trouble getting that Mexican Wall funded, he's busy erecting many symbolic walls with our allies. The fact that industry, education, and state and municipal governments are stepping forward speaks volumes.""Walter, unfortunately you are all too right. Climatologists (&amp; anybody with the intelligence to understand science and extrapolate into the future) saw this coming a half-century ago. I remember a talk given by a professor, a nuclear physicist, at my college in the late 1960s. He had worked with Einstein, Bohr, &amp; Dirac among other brilliant nuclear physicists at Princeton's Institute for Advanced Studies. He talked about nuclear power &amp; asserted it could be the force that powered the planet once scientists had worked out how to make fusion reactors that didn't produce deadly radioactive waste. He estimated that, if science put together a project like the Manhattan Project or JFK's drive to put a man on the moon, it should be a reality in 40 to 50 years - right about now.Unfortunately, his call for a new Manhattan-style project was ignored by politicians who couldn't understand the concept of spending money that didn't have immediate payback for their contributors or districts, so the government never funded it. About 3 years ago, I was having breakfast with a group who met every morning in Princeton that included professors, our congressman, and others all the way down the social ladder to one of Princeton's gardeners. I asked a young physicist about how long he anticipated it would take to create nuclear fusion power plants. He thought for a minute and said ""about 50 years - if we start a gov't funded Manhattan project today."" But, of course Trump &amp; the GOP won't.""Unfortunately the US withdrawing from the largely symbolic climate accord will make little difference either way because most environmentalists and major environmental groups are too stupid and cowardly to strongly advocate for the stabilization of the ever increasing ecosystem destroying and polluting human population. It makes no scientific or mathematic sense to fiddle with a few percent CO2 reductions here and there when the total of homes, businesses, cars, machines that are needed for 1 billion more humans every 15 years continually increases and millions of acres of carbon absorbing forest and range land are bulldozed and built over every year to support them. And we also have ""liberal"" democrats like economist Larry Summers expounding that the earth can easy support 15 billion people (with no data!) because the ""human imagination is infinite"". There's just as much none scientific magical thinking on the liberal left! While the academic and political Left accuses those concerned about exceeding earth's carrying capacity of racism (while it is likely none whites will die in the largest numbers when regional bio collapses occur), which is equally as stupid and suicidal as the right accusing those who dare say the P word of being baby killers for providing access to contraception.""""But now President Trump (and 22 Republican senators who wrote a letter asking him to take the step) is betting that all of that is wrong. ""Who are the 22 Republican senators? Let's see that list and the letter please.""I agree with everything said in the article excerpt this: "" It undercuts our civilizationâ€™s chances of surviving global warming..."" There is no evidence civilization will not survive global warming. The issue is the vast array of social and biological problems it will cause.""A lot of sound and fury. The Paris Accord was too little, too late.If YOU would have listened to US forty-seven years ago, WE wouldn't be in trouble NOW.""Thanks to Trump, America is no longer the leader of the free world. Moreover, our country has abdicated its position as the economic powerhouse in green technology to unfree China. With Trump, everything is a lose lose proposition.""In one respect, and one only, Trump may be correct. Our withdrawal from the Paris treaty may in fact be a boon to American employment. Think of the tens of thousands of construction jobs that will be created to build the huge retaining walls needed to keep the ocean out of our coastal cities. There's also the countless emergency workers needed to fight worsening wildfires and help in areas devastated by floods, super storms and droughts. Desalinization plants to replace lost fresh groundwater is another growing opportunity. For those who subscribe to the mantra of ""drill baby drill"", how do they feel about having deep water oil and gas rigs in the heart of the Midwest? Trump has demonstrated time and again that he'll do anything to make the spotlight on himself ever brighter, even if it means condemning the world to our own self-destruction.""Perhaps it's time we came up with a different name for ""conservatives."" They're more about exploiting than conserving.""Itâ€™s obvious now, if it wasnâ€™t before, that Trump is 100% a politician. The choice to appeal to his base rather than make a decision for the welfare of all the citizens of this country and the world proves that he is not the president of all the people. It takes true character to make a potentially unpopular decision that could affect reelection. Trump has demonstrated over and over that he has no character and very little intellect to be President. Four years is too long to wait for his removal.""Part of America wanted change and disliked tolerance, facts, and reasoned discourse. It elected to the presidency of the United States an ignorant and temperamental scam artist with a record of serial bankruptcies, bilking creditors, and abusing opponents with no regard for decency or truth. Trump's candidacy was built on lies, abuse, insults, and stirring up racial, class, and xenophobic resentments. With his background in pro wrestling and the TV of illusions, he was unconstrained by reality, knowledge, shame, or decency. Meanwhile, the Republican party had become an insurgency committed to blocking and rolling back every progressive measure of the Obama presidency, and to cut taxes for the wealthy at the cost of the middle-class and the poor. The combination of the Republican majority in Congress and the Trump presidency is disastrous to America and the world. The consequences of the Trump administration may be felt for centuries by millions all over the world as global warming wreaks havoc on food production and drives coastal flooding, migrations, refugee flows, and collapse of weak states. Meanwhile, millions of Americans will die earlier and be sicker and poorer if these policies prevail.""No one is indispensable, whether as an individual or as a head of the most powerful nation on the planet. I like Macron's response to Trump and the world yesterday after Trump's announcement. The Paris Accord will go on, with or without US participating. Just because a buffoon of a president of the US doesn't want to be part it, the Accord doesn't need to derail. Just the same, Americans too, individuals and corporations alike, can defy Trump's decision and do what is right.""The United States can do its parts without signing an agreement where we send billions to poor countries and implement very drastic measures costing billions and perhaps millions of jobs.The worlds population is growing, developing countries are exploding adding cities, factories, coal plants, pollution. These countries have the chance to implement cleaner pollution control. Build some hydroelectric dams, solar, wind, tidal, etc.All possible without an accord from Paris.""Trump's provocative act elicited responses in kind. His withdrawal has led many cities and states to resist him, most corporations including Exxon disagree with the withdrawal. Even if the Paris Accord was a ""bad deal"", the answer is to work within it, not to withdraw wholesale.The result of Trump's withdrawal will be redoubled efforts to reduce carbon emissions, and it may lead to a carbon tax and other policies that will lower our huge carbon footprint. Trump may prove to be the environmentalists' best friend, albeit unwittingly. Stay tuned.""The former head of the USA Hurricane Center is Dr. Neil Frank. He believes,as do many others, that climate change is caused by sun spot activity. Goingback to historical reoords, Dr. Frank makes a strong case. The cities in whichthe atmosphere is polluted, such as Beijing, certainly should do what they can to eliminate smog, for the sake of the inhabitants. However, arbitrary cuts in the use of energy will have no significant effect on climate change. The bureaucrats in Washington and Brussels have not yet discovered how to control the sun.""Fine, those for the accord can raise themselves the $40 billion annually that the US was expected to contribute to the green energy fund rather than US taxpayers. That's why we left the accord, but no one is talking about that.""So the upcoming election is the opportunity for the Democratic Party to rouse itself and regain control of the legislative branch and defend climate action. Among the system's checks and balances, nothing beats elections.President Obama believes young people should get into politics. This is why.""President Donald Trump made a disastrous choice to get out of the Paris climate agreement. If the US does not heed the suggestions to prevent more global warming, the earth will drastically change for the worse---flooded coastlines, unbearable heat, and fierce storms will result. These problems are for the not too distant future.However, if Trump faces a crisis in the near future and makes the wrong choice, we will most likely have disaster on earth sooner.Perhaps a disaster in the near future will so affect the earth that it will be unfit to live on. If this happens, the good news is we win't have to worry any more about global warming.""Your looking at this all wrong.Â Â Look at the millions of new jobs that will be created to try and reverse global warming and to deal with its consequence.Â Carbon dioxide collectors, plant based fuel for aircraft, solar panels and wind turbines and of course mortuary and crematorium services for all the billions of people who will die because of global warming.""Clearly, we have negative leadership coming from D.C. , but we, the people, can take up the banner of intelligent decision, and join the fight to preserve the planet. Each and every one of us can do our part, and it is uplifting to realize the cities and states will join us. Support those companies leading the way...we can do this.""If politicians were offered more $ by supporters of reduction in carbon emissions the American congress would be all for slowing this climate change. Alas, visible and hidden $ overwhelming from petroleum and coal interests, supports denying any climate change, especially related to fossil fuels. Our government is thus captive to this dangerous policy. Many American voters don't appear educated enough to understand the problem and vote accordingly.We're entering an unknown with this problem in that it may turn out much worse than our current predictions. An ugly legacy for our children.""We should also be pointing fingers and hollering at the big oil companies. They are just as compliant in all of this. Long before Trump, they were heavily involved with climate change, science denial and propped up various paid scientists to counteract the researcher's data. Straight out propaganda that is still believed today by many. The involvement of big oil is the culprit. They started this war on science decades ago. This is worse than those cigarette companies. Much, much worse."It's time for states to form regional powers and go it alone. I'm tired of being dragged back into the past. Time to move forward and work to fix our problems in our own."The former head of the USA Hurricane Center is Dr. Neil Frank. He believes,as do many others, that climate change is caused by sun spot activity. Goingback to historical reoords, Dr. Frank makes a strong case.

The bureaucrats in Washington and Brussels have not yet discovered how to control the sum."It's a great distraction from the Russia investigations. Preserve us."The mark of a good leader is the ability to review the facts and admit to an earlier mistake and to correct it. In Trump we have a creature that not only refuses to ever admit mistakes, but continues to make more every day in the face of knowledgable counsel and clear evidence and data. Every sound leader needs the confidence of his followers to be effective. In Trump we now have a useless leader, one who has lost the confidence of his people by his own actions in such a manner it can never be recovered. This country is in dire straits.""Trump's name should and will go down in infamy. It should be joined by the names of the 22 GOP senators who urged him forward and the numerous Republican House Representatives whose willful ignorance and self-serving greed have supported this disastrous Republican charade of governance. I urge the NY TImes to publish on a daily basis the names of those Republican ""public servants"" who have betrayed their country and the world. They all deserve to be known and remembered for what they have done. We the People and History will hold them accountable starting now.""Who believes Trump's mindless drivel that abandoning the Paris Agreement will create jobs? Who believes the nonsense that the world will somehow be impressed by us, because ""they were laughing at us before, but they're not laughing now?""Trump is the political equivalent of the unhinged man with a gun, who kills a stranger for the thrill of it. How ironic, then, that he once said he could ""walk out on Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and they'd still vote for me"". His base wants a tough guy who takes action. Apparently forethought, and resulting consequences of his actions are irrelevant to them.Reasoning with this people is a fool's errand, and the informed world--both Americans and others--needs to start acting responsibly to correct matters, both inside and outside of the polling booth.""The Republicans need to take responsibility for their candidate and see to it that he moves into a luxury facility with nursing care and a door that locks from the outside, and then they need to figure out what to do with all the people he picked out to help him destroy America."We have now become the enemy of our planet and enemy of the rest of the world's people.This doesn't prevent anybody or any business in America from doing what they think is right regarding carbon emissions."It is increasingly clear we are dealing with an emotional 2-year old as our 'place holder' in the oval office. It doesn't matter if the facts overwhelmingly weigh in the opposite direction, he will show you who is in charge! These are actions of a cruel child. A previous article indicated Trump was like the Twilight Zone episode youngster with life and death powers; adults around him coddle him to avoid being turned into a tree or killed. They were right. Even the study he used to rational-lies his argument was debunked soon after it was published. Lies lies lies. What is it going to take to invoke the 25th Amendment???""Never mind the Russians or the conflicts of interest. Never mind all the lies and disinformation, exaggerations and self-aggrandizing howlers. Don't pay attention to how much he and his family costs us or the potential damage he will do to the country.The biggest mystery is why Trump is so obsessed with Obama. Why is he so set on wrecking everything Obama did? He wants make Obama illegitimate, even though, or maybe because, unlike Trump, Obama was lawfully-elected by a substantial majority of diverse voters.It's unseemly, cringe-making, unsettling to be so fixated. But that's nothing new with Trump.""It's astounding that this Op-Ed page is amplifying what is in your science coverage on how disastrous global warming is going to be - your own reporting shows that it is going to kill tens of millions of people through expanded ranges for malaria, climate caused stresses on societies like Syria, and so on - and you are still allowing Bret Stephens to do his climate know-nothing nonsense on the same page. It's kinda like you don't really believe the importance of what you're covering. If it was garden variety holocaust denial you would never do this. It's why I unsubscribed. Take this issue seriously and stop providing a platform for someone with no scientific tools to deny reality.""I'm not an electrical engineer nor quantum physicist, but I still believe in and use a smart phone every dayI'm not an aeronautical engineer nor understand the Whitcomb area rule, but I still believe in and use jet aircraft &gt;10 times per yearI'm not a molecular biologist nor cardiologist, but I still believe in and use a blood thinner every dayI'm not a climate scientist, but I still believe in climate change...........because I ""believe in"" .... Science""As long as Americans continue to see this as a matter of Red States and Blue States, or Republicans vs. Democrats, they've missed the point -- just like there's no way to present scientific facts to an un-scientific mind.For those housed in the ignorance of their own beliefs, there's no logical or rational way to present facts in a way they'll understand, which is why Donald Trump was able to arrive at a decision as stupid and reckless as this one is.But fortunately there are still cities, states and even major industries who have taken it upon themselves to carry on where Trump has officially signed off.A country is only as great as the sum of its parts.And some of our parts look great."The hubris and greed of this man and his ilks amount to crimes against humanity. They should be prosecuted for it.Is America great again yet?"This decision is not about climate change just as the decision to destroy the ACA was not about health care. It is about racism. The republican party and the president* are out to destroy Obama's legacy. They want to destroy everything a man of color achieved. Of course this will not be the focus of any discussion because it is never about race in America and yet, on a deep level, it is always about race in America. Always has been."This reminds me of the scene in Monty Python's THE LIFE OF BRIAN of the Black Death...they were picking up the dead bodies in carts. This will be our planet if nothing is done about climate change....famine...already happening...plagues....already happening...war....ongoing for decade plus.Trump is Lex Luther. But where is our Superman or Superwoman? Please come soon.Thank you Bill!"Two words no one ever spoke or wrote about President Obama, stupid and reckless. The decision made the way a petulant child makes decisions.Thankfully California and New York move forward with this anyway. California by itself is the worlds 6th largest economy. Because of that most businesses comply with California laws because they need to be part of that market.Getting a Democratic congress elected next year is imperative if the country is to survive.

This should have been a New York Times headline last month rather than a sentence in the next to last paragraph of this article.""I don't have children, but this Trump endangers the world as we know it and foretells of a grim future we will leave future generations.Economically, renewables are investments' only target - no one is putting money behind coal - so the markets are already on board with the new climate reality. That will continue even as Trump smashes the Paris Accord. The Trump base may believe that there are still jobs in coal, but the mayors and governors in their regions should look at the California model that has created in that one state more renewable energy jobs that are in the coal energy nationwide. If they want jobs for their people, they should look at what works, and emulate that, rather than stoking the 20th Century models that don't provide a fraction of jobs today."There have been very sucessful boycotts in the past and consumer can continue to boycott today. No driving one day a week can make the oil companies squeal. I reduced my driving to 2 days a week and make use of other forms of transportation.

Moreover the best thing voters can do is show up and vote against Republican's attempts to turn their backs on climate change."Just restoration of the Pacific Coast kelp forests and Enhydra Lutris, the keystone species that protects them from sea urchins would go a long ways toward meeting the Paris goals, because kelp is a major sequestration mechanism for carbon.It's something we otter do.""You bet against science, diplomacy, and the environment, who do you think will win?""Yeah, but we can put a few coal miners back to work.

The states will continue to implement policies limiting carbon emissions. isnt this more about optics than substance?""Beautifully thought, argued and written. Thank you, Mr. McKibben."They said the world was round - not flat and that the earth wasn't the center of the universe. Scientists. Are we actually having this argument? Today?"Trump looks at the world through the lens of Reality TV. He does not filter the world through the lens of science or morality or responsibility. Will there be controversy, headlines, TV coverage? True to form, he makes a big Reality TV â€œrevealâ€ out of his decision to leave the Paris Accord. He focuses only on what builds his brand and creates publicity. Trumpâ€™s worldview revolves around creating the worldâ€™s biggest Reality TV show. Celebrity Apprentice Gone Wild.""All this paranoid hype over a climate accord that is voluntary. May I remind all the Chicken Little's in here that the sky is not going to fall , that the United States never signed on to the Kyoto Accords, either. The sky was supposed to fall because of that, too. But it didn't. And we're still here. Greenhouse gasses have been reduced, and billions have been invested in renewables. The freight train going foreword toward renewables cannot be stopped - and if American businesses see a little competitive advantage pulling out of this Paris agreement, right or wrong, they can't be stopped from doing that, anyway - they're too powerful. And this whole incident with the Paris accords will ultimately go down as a footnote in history, just like Kyoto.""Don't worry. With major US cities declaring bold renewable targets on a daily basis; with 70% of Americans understanding the global warming situation; with the rest of the civilised world actually doing something about global warming, Mr Trump's incompetent decision will have little effect anyway. Along with his walls and his tweets, the end result will be nothing. In fact, the only lasting change we're likely to derive from the 45th President will be the firm conviction of the American people, and the people of the world, to never, ever, vote for such a woefully inadequate person again.""Where are the religious in this? How can anyone who takes seriously the idea that our world was created by a Higher Power (whatever name you choose to call It by) not see it as our reverent duty to treat that creation with respect? How can the very same representatives who cloak themselves in religion when the issue is a woman's right to abort one fetus vote to abort countless species, ultimately including our own? The churches, synagogues, temples, mosques, etc. need to speak out loud and long about this, and tell their worshipers that fouling the Lord's creation is a sin and working to preserve and cherish it is holy. They must teach, and lead by example. This is not only a science issue, it's a moral issue as well, and that is where faith has a great deal to contribute.""Thank goodness CA, WA, NY, British Columbia, and other sub-nation groups are banding together to continue the positive changes the west-coast coalition of states and nations have achieved so far. All is not yet lost and some intelligent leaders are still working to save the climate.Jerry Brown is my hero this morning.""The Paris Agreement has always been too little, too late, but it has extremely important symbolic value. The frightening, little understood, fact is that climate change could end human life within a decade.Should the current data under EXTINCTION at Arctic News prove correct â€“ humanity could disappear no later than 2026 - without a dramatic 80% reduction in fossil fuel use.We face OMNICIDE: The total extinction of the human species as a result of human action. This is the greatest emergency humans have ever confronted. Every means should be employed to publicize, discuss and attack the Global Warming problem without delay.Bombers rolled off an assembly line every hour during WWII. Breakthrough new energy systems are much less complex. Several are discussed at: ""http://aesopinstitute.org"" title=""aesopinstitute.org"" aesopinstitute.orgMost reflect hard-to-believe new science. Some exploit a surprising loophole in the Second Law of Thermodynamics (only recently recognized by scientists at Argonne National Laboratory and elsewhere). AESOP engines can run 24/7 on atmospheric ambient (solar) energy, without fuel! They can scale and provide a cheap, faster alternative to rooftop panels, wind and solar farms!Breakthroughs usually require a generation to gain acceptance. We do not have that luxury.Innovation is severely underfunded at promising small firms. Mass production of the best systems will follow. Speed the process on an emergency basis - the lives you save may include everyone you care about.""Trump said he was ready to renegotiate the Paris Climate Agreement. Put the same document in front of him (he never reads what he signs), call it the Trump Climate Agreement ... et voila!""This is the time bomb planted in the Constitution exploding in our faces. The system for electing national policy makers allows a minority to control all aspects of government. It is about more than the Electoral College. The GOP controls the Senate, but those states it represents are a minority of the population. Our governance currently resembles South Africa in the 1960s-- control vested in an autocratic white minority out to protect itself. (This is from a 62 year old Southern white guy.)""People who care about climate change need to start understanding the concerns of conservatives and attend to these concerns. Otherwise, we will have a split electorate that can't address the issue and/or we will be doomed to a future where one party promptly wipes out the progress made by the other party in perpetuity. I live in California and the CEQA law is something that used to be good for the environment, but it is now a destructive force and liberals are doing nothing about it. The CEQA law is being used by NIMBYs everywhere to block denser housing near transit. As a result, housing is astronomically expensive and if any new housing does get built, it is in greenfield areas on the outskirts of metro areas, which leads to sprawl and long car commutes. Jerry Brown and state republicans tried to fix this, but the liberal majority in the state house and senate won't pass his reform. In the SF bay area, there are tons of extremist conservation groups who use CEQA to block things like bike infrastructure and mass transit. In Marin County, a portion of the county was built on marsh land back in the 50's. Now, groups like Marin Audubon use CEQA to block bike paths, dredging to create and maintain ferry terminals and mass transit like the new SMART train because these things will occur in marsh land that is already heavily developed. We have horrible car traffic on the SF bay perimeter, but can't expand ferry service. It is absurd.""And yet, ever since this disastrous announcement, the stock markets continue to rise. Just like the level of the sea. Anyone care to venture a guess how high the Dow when the rising East and Hudson Rivers begin to spill over Wall Street?""All this would be irrelevant if you do as I do:1. Get solar panels on your home. I lease mine. Sunrun paid me to take the lease :). No money down. Now saving $20/month on electricity. Coming next year: battery storage systems like Tesla's Powerwall. I could potentially go off grid living in a big city.2. Get an electric vehicle. Mine is a 2013 Chevy Volt. You can get a used Volt or Leaf for less than $10,000. Cost to operate at 10 cents/KwH is 2 cents/mile. Compare to IRS allowance at 56 cents/mile. If you can claim it on taxes, its like getting paid $30/hour to drive.3. Talk it up with everyone I meet. If, say, 10% of households did this, the drop in demand for fossil fuels (coal, gasoline) would drop just enough and given slim profit margins in fossil fuels, vast swaths of the fossil fuel industry would collapse and take their ""paid politicians"" like Trump with them.4. Stop talking, start doing. You will actually save a) money and b) the planet."We either want to help self the planet or not.Trump is now squarely on the side of letting the planet die."Congratulation America, you went from voodoo economics to pure voodoo. With government messianic fervor we are quickly replacing science with conspiracy theories, experimental evidence with alternate facts and balanced information with FakesNews level propaganda. All over the nation I see fellow scientists scurrying away their objective data in fear that their peer reviewed findings could be a odds with the alternate scientific reality fancied by lesser minds. None of this will make it to the 6 o'clock news but it is alarming nevertheless. Last April, during the march for science, one of us put it very well. Her sign said ""And don't grab my data either"". OK, in Rome do like the romans, let me go back to the dirty blond hair color puppet I just made. I got a lot of needles to put through it."Every American president has a legacy. Donald Trump's legacy will be that he helped to make the world hotter and more polluted. Sad to say that his supporters agree with his positions because they are so ill informed.Incompetence has no boundaries. In deference to Dr. Lawrence Peters we can posit that Trump has reached his level of incompetence.Even from a purely selfish perspective Trump's decision was stupid. Climate change is not an optional issue. It is a grave national and global security threat."I think anyone who has brain in their head, sees the effects industrialisation has on the Earth's environment, from pollution's effects to the waves of mass extinctions of the planet's life. The problem is not Trump but his mindless minions following the dictator with huge leaps of logic and fantasy. The Paris accord did not do enough yet is was a beginning and certainly better than doing nothing; contrary to Trump's talk about making a new deal. The truth is no new deal will be made. It's all smoke and the ones smoking it are his followers. When the bill comes due, for the reckless behaviour of the Trump administration. we, the majority of Americans who did not vote for Trump should not forget nor should we forgive our, foolish, hateful, follow citizens. At that time, I'm sure they will be nowhere to be seen and will slither back into the darkness. leaving the rest of us to clean up the mess...""Donald J. Trump will go down in history as the worst president ever in the history of the United States, but the story of our country will end prematurely due to this enormously stupid decision.""Hey all, let's cool it. So we're on the road to irreparably messing up. But rest assured, our rocky planet can take it. The rocks will survive until Sol goes nova. It's just the wormy life forms that might not make it...at least in the shapes we're used to (the forces of evolution will take care of that)."Everything that Trump does now is an attempt to make his super rich friends happy (and that includes trying to destroy all that Obama did) and to try to distract us from the the FBI investigation against his administration.That's it."Stupid and reckless yes, but also short-sighted and needy. He promised the coal miners their jobs back (because he needs that adoration from them) and this is his ham-fisted way of trying. It sounds good in his head so it must be true. If this were the 19th century, he'd be telling blacksmiths that he was going to outlaw cars.""I don't do twitter, but please, somebody who does, get this out there:TRUMP DID NOT WIN PITTSBURGH.Clinton took it by 16 points.The mayor of Pittsburgh has pledged to follow the Paris guidelines.Drump can't even get his catchphrases right."I can easily foresee a future where Trump and his click of climate deniers and greedy billionaires are taken to the international tribunal for crime against humanity!"""Nobody cares more about the environment than me. I'm gonna renegotiate. It's gonna be the best deal you've ever seen. They'll be unicorns and rainbows and jobs, jobs, jobs for everyone. Believe me.""""The tragic irony is that the black primary voters who were entirely responsible for the Dems nominating the most despised candidate in the party's history are the ones who caused this and every other Trump disaster. The Rust Belt exit polls offered us incontrovertible evidence that had Bernie been on the ballot he would have swept the Rust Belt easily and crushed Trump nationally. Sanders would have done NOTHING that feminists, environmentalists, working-class whites, and , yes, the mass of black people would have disliked. But the foolish black primary voters listened to the well-bought Congressional Black Caucus and black preachers, and voted the way Goldman Sachs wanted, instead of listening to real black progressives like Ben Jealous, Harry Belafonte, Spike Lee, Cornell West, Keith Ellison, and Killer Mike, and the rest is our current terrible history. Stupid votes bring ruin, folks. You vote to nominate a loser, you get defeat."There isn't much new in Trump being nuts; just that the examples now are more serious than being able to count or stay on message."Mr. McKibben: ""stupid and reckless"" is all that needs to be said - it tells the whole story. Our descendants will pay the bill. If they survive........."Any action DT takes is a pathological need to smash everything that President Obama accomplished.DT claims it's because of jobs- but the prominent CEOs of this country that actually supply jobs ( and don't declare bankruptcy and stiff contractors)- so it's not really about jobs. That's just another lie out of his countless lies every time he opens his mouth.It's about getting even with Obama since President Obama left office with a high approval rating- and DT has very low approvals and he cannot get over the fact he actually lost the election by popular vote. He's mentally unstable and needs to be removed from office in a straightjacket or handcuffs- take your pick."So 'the great negotiator' folds, even though he was dealt a great hand. Trump has no vision. Or maybe he walked away because he doesnâ€™t know how to play and didnâ€™t want to look bad. What a loser.""Another blunder to add to this madman's growing list of spiteful acts.He once again lies, appealing to his naive and ignorant supporters using job growth or fairy tales of economic benefits to the American people.How much more damage must he be allowed to wreak before his removal from office?""TRUMP as a kid started food fights at birthday parties. He's continuing the pattern as President (I gag when I say the word referring to him). Trump sees everything he does as an opportunity to start a food fight. Meaning that he is unsocialized, boorish, reckless, selfish and terminally idiotic. Going through life as a series of food fights has caused him frequent failures in business and a well-deserved reputation as a nasty, dishonest, unethical, immoral person. The sole advantage of starting a food fight that has to do with the Paris Climate Accord, is that if it happened in France, the food was magnificent. Letting Trump have access to it is casting pearls before the swine.""This immoral act is that of a despicable demon whose vile hatred for Obama has blinded him to everything except the glee he derives from dismantling, indeed smashing, everything Obama accomplished and stood for. To have so much power in the hands of this fundamentally flawed and flagrantly mean person who thrives on high drama (the national and global response to his mad, staged decision is far more appealing to him than the quiet agreement he should have given a week ago) is more and more terrifying. And universally mortifying. He and the 22 Republican congressional supporters of this idiocy are reprehensible.""""Stupid is what stupid does."" Our president has no capacity for intellectual thought. He'll run this country like one of his businesses, and it will come crashing down like one of his failing casinos. He's handing over the reins of the world's economy to China and Russia. It's like watching a horrific accident in slow motion. Our only hope is 2018.""Trump and his fossil fool friends are congratulating themselves today, but most of America despises them and disagrees with their decision. Americans MUST step up and challenge this stupid and reckless decision. Go solar. Reduce your carbon footprint and teach your children how to live sustainably. If you care about the future, take action. Don't let Trump destroy our children's future.""Billy Bush recently revealed that it was the wrath that his teenage daughters unleashed upon him for 'egging on' Donald Trump that shook him to his core. Those 22 Republican senators who encouraged Trump to make this decision on the Paris climate accord should listen to their children and grandchildren on how their spiteful words and actions have placed the planet's future in jeopardy. An article with the names and profiles of the 22 Republican senators ('big oil darlings') is at this url (The Guardian): ""https://goo.gl/x2WLOA"" title=""https://goo.gl/x2WLOA"" https://goo.gl/x2WLOA"Let's send Trump to Mars.. Its atmosphere is almost pure CO2 (96%). He'll love it there. And don't bring him back!"When the rest of the world wakes up and puts a carbon tax on all American goods that they import, I suppose Donald will react like the petulant adolescent that he is."A leader who doesn't know what he doesn't know. How blissful for him. How terrifying for us.We are quickly becoming the laughingstock of the civilized world.Shame on us."He is a reckless buffoon, no doubt. Nothing he does shows intelligence, understanding and thoughtfulness. Just an insecure, ignorant fool taking the world down with him.The rest of us have to try and reduce our own energy use where feasible. And buy products from companies that care about the future and strive to reduce their GHG emissions. Try and boycott all businesses that are not environmentally responsible. Economic pressure is all that will get the attention of the greedy oligarchs. Trump, the repubs and their supporters are a complete disgrace to the human race. Let's remove as many as we can in 2018.""It is seriously difficult to know whether this "" decision "" was Manchurian or just inept: at a stroke your President has potentially handed the economic and moral high ground to the Chinese.. is that what the Republican party wants?""Doesn't matter if it is real, if it is backed by science...if it's got Obama's fingerprints on it this clueless rich kid will try and destroy it. He seems to be motivated by hate of his predecessor. This is evidenced by many ridiculous statements, beginning with the birther notion of a Kenyan birthplace for Mr. Obama and includes at least one clearly false tweet about wire tapping. I'm sure that books will be written about why this man hates Obama...but I suspect it has something to do with the idea that he is annoyed by the facts that Obama has many things that cannot be bought...Obama is widely respected, he has a stable marriage, he is articulate. None of these things can be said about our current president and, in his world, it's always personal.""Every Trump decision brings to mind that quote from Don Corleone:""I spent my whole life trying not to be careless. Women and children can afford to be careless, but not men."" We truly have a careless child in the White House."One more step in ensuring that America is never great! What a disgrace!Science and Diplomacy - bad. Civilization - bad. God help us."Trump needs to be set adrift on a melting antarctic ice floe, and left there to experience the utter foolishness of his decisions.""Before announcing his decision in the Rose Garden, the sun king looked in his golden mirror, and quoting himself, asked: ""WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO LOSE?"""A new crack on American integrity. How much more does it take for the whole thing to collapse? The president can't wait to find out."President Bannon wrote a speech for his ""Hand Puppet"" , Donald Trump to give yesterday, and he sounded like Charlie McCarthy's ventriloquist Dummie, nothing more needs to be said other than I feel like our country isn't a leader in the world that we were last year at this time.""President Bannon wrote a speech for his ""Hand Puppet"" , Donald Trump to give yesterday, and he sounded like Charlie McCarthy's ventriloquist Dummie, nothing more needs to be said other than I feel like our country isn't a leader in the world that we were last year at this time."Trump is the result of too many good and smart people being too lazy to get out and vote. Shame on you if you were eligible to vote but didn't."The best thing that each one of us as American citizens can do is cut consumption and reduce waste. We have become the most wasteful nation on earth, and we can send the message and renew our leadership position in the world by going back to the values of our ancestors: frugality, efficiency and self-reliance. When approximately 70% of the US economy is based on consumer spending for products which are made using fossil fuels, we can vote with our wallets and fundamentally change the way we use resources. We cannot wait for the wealthy and powerful to do the right thing. WE have the power to do the right thing, right now."Actually I applaud Trump get getting us out of the stupid pact. The Chinese are the biggest polluters on the planet. They do not have to abide by anything for 20 years. How fair is that. Level the playing field."Greed, Ignorance and Spite. The TRUMP Doctrine.""Trump and his GOP are so in love with wallowing in their grievance(s) against Obama (and liberals) that they're serving up their children and grandchildren as guinea pigs to find out if human actions are heating up the planet. The project of making America great again apparently entails sinking to the bligliest depths of ignorance, nihlism and amorality seen in American political life.""Well just another example that when you select a jerk to be a leader, he behaves exactly as he is ...we outside of the US see Trump as the proof that when you have a big number of lower educated voters and a significant group of weak and lousy politicians the US has this kind of leadership...sad for the US and very sad for the rest of the world.""Trump's narcissism and his templated real estate dealing mindset leads to a fundamental paradox. He wants a better financial deal in the Paris agreement, a deal that favors Pittsburg citizens and not Paris citizens? This Trumpian folly is based in two erroneous assumptions:1. Its the whole earth climate that is of concern; not the climate in Pittsburg. So Trump's thinking is in the wrong church, and he is sitting in the wrong pew. Duh!2. The more serious error is his premise that you can negotiate with mother nature. Remember ""its not nice to fool mother nature."" This was a line in a margarine commercial. Our president has severe limitations in his fund of information and in his reasoning skills. Nothing new in this observation.What will be new is the damage he causes across the world including the US. This damage will cut across all aspects of the quality of life in Pittsburg as well as on Earth. JCS""Now, if only you could get the wimpy Democrats to speak out so forthrightly against trump and the republicans on this and every other issue. I'm getting so sick of them being cowards afraid to call out liars, afraid to use the word stupid, When will they learn that their meekness and cowardice has NEVER been rewarded??""Trump acts only and entirely out of ignorance and is driven by a need for revenge against President Obama, who mocked him. Everything he does is based on this - it's ALL about HIM ""getting even."" Beyond sad - it's SICK!""The only hoax is Donald Trump and his White House minions. Oh, yes andthe Republicans still clinging to the old days. Let's hope 45's recklessmove loses each and every last Milennial voter. Is there a greeting cardavailable to send our apologies to the rest of the world? Imagine what thehistorians will write about the fall of his administration and the formerUnited States of America.""Americans bear responsibility for this tragedy. The United States has been history's biggest polluter. And now when the bill comes due, it runs away....Sitting here in Asia, I'm watching the US give up whatever credibility it still had. Americans love to confer upon themselves titles like ""leader of the free world"". That was always a stretch. Now its a bad joke!""The Paris Climate Accord has absolutely nothing to do with American sovereignty. This is a foul canard. The President also seems to enjoy saying that the world was laughing at the United States, which is another of his many lies and his typical jingoistic baloney used to rile up his America First supporters. I am not surprised the U.S. is lumped in with Syria and Nicaragua as being in the only 3 nations that did not sign the accord. Appalling company to keep.The false clappers he assembled to cheer his words were like sycophants cheering a dictator.The bottom line is that the President's typical silliness and inability to handle complex issues will cost America jobs and cost the lives of millions the world over as time passes. Shame on him.""He may be ""heâ€™s wagering that he was actually right"" but we are going to be the losers.""I've read more than one conservative who says, ""Now liberals know what it felt like for us when Obama was president."" No, please, spare me. I am sure they felt anger at Obama and his policies, but anger is different from the sadness, sorrow and shame we liberals feel at President Trump--especially today, with his decision to pull us from the Paris Accord. To all conservatives who are the least bit educated, I ask you, Is this really what you wanted? A vulgarian of the first order who, as president, gleefully parades his reality TV persona? A barely literate, profoundly ignorant man (by his own admission, he never reads anything) who's making decisions about our country's future? An ignorant man who's decided that climate change is a hoax and that America needs to ""go it alone""? It's our children that I weep for. Our children.""We descended from this:""This was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal.""--Barack Obamato this:â€œI applaud President Trump and his administration for dealing yet another significant blow to the Obama administrationâ€™s assault on domestic energy production and jobs,â€ said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader.Truly criminal.""In a sense, we aren't recognizing where Trump is coming from.. He doesn't believe in the science. This comes from a man who jams fast food in his mouth all the time. A man who believes that human energy is limited and shouldn't be wasted. He had to use a golf cart when other world leaders walked. (Or is that an excuse for such low exercise tolerance he would have gotten out of breath. Oh yeah his world renown doctor says he is incredibly fit). He should take up smoking. And when he gets sick forget the antibiotics. And when he gets cancer, forget the chemo and immunotherapy. I urge all Americans to send him a pack of Camel straights. The science on smoking and cancer just can't be trusted. And while you are at it, send a carton to Scott Pruitt.""Trump is the real world Manchurian Candidate. Trump has created the leadership vacuum that both Beijing and Moscow have been praying vigorously for decades. Trump has delivered their prayers on a gold trimmed, silver platter."Rex Tillerson should resign.Super melodramatic with portents of doom. Music up....The world should boycott American made goods.The president just doesn't play well with others."OK, lets just admit it, â€¦. the world is only 4000 years old, all the animals who got on the ark are still with us, dinosaurs are only a figment of some mad scientists fantasy, the world is flat, the sun revolves around the earth. And all humans will happily be living in some sort of space bubble dome when the oxygen leaves the planet. At least the latter should create a lot of jobs.""I feel sick, embrassed, ashamed and ready to march in the streets- Who will join me?"I thought he had grandchildren. Does he know?"An absurd article . Facts: The worlds massive polluters are to do nothing until 2030 while the USA must pay billions. Even MIT says this treaty did nothing for world air quality. It was a fraud and I urge people to read its 20 pages. Obama had no Senate approval and therefore it was a faux treaty with a political headline but no real meaning. People need to read it and see what a miserable useless ""treaty"" it is.""Stupid is not a strong enough word to describe Mr. Trump's decision it is treason. Impeach and convict him of an ill conceived attempt to destroy our country's standing, our good will, friendship and trust with other countries of our world.DESPICABLE, MR.TRUMP, INEXCUSABLE; YOU ARE UNFIT AS PRESIDENT OF MY COUNTRY, THE USA."Too bad the Czar of our country doesn't read!

These places don't even have functioning governments. Better to spend that money here in the US or flush it down the toilet."The President, his family, his cabinet, and congressional leaders must be jailed for the heinous crimes against society.

The forces of short term gain at all costs have found a willing patsy in the individual that now occupies the White House because of course 'short term' is all he cognitively capable of. But what this ignorant buffoon does not understand is that Nature always bats last. One day Mar a Lago ( Spanish for 'Sea to Lake') will simply be Mar. Perhaps then it will register.""The anti-science nutjobs are no longer lurking in the shadows but are sitting in the White House raining evil down upon the entire world.

How long will we tolerate a reckless, deliberately ignorant, lying, malignant buffoon in the White House making decisions that will kill innocent people? The question should no linger be: Is this impeachable. Who cares? It is overwhelmingly important that he be relieved of the powers of the Presidency as quickly and completely as possible. That this seems to be a partisan question says everything about the Party of Stupid, doubling down on stupid to insure the mindless support of of the stupid for astonishingly stupid policies. That this is a politically partisan issue is like debating the breed of a mad dog, lurching toward us, foaming at the mouth. It is time to declare Removal Day, for millions to march on the White House, and for decent Americans to do whatever they need to to shut down business as usual down until Congress removes him. Obstruction, witness tampering, revealing classified info to the Russians, 25 years of laundering their plunder, baseless, almost insane slanders against his predecessor and former opponent, gibberish tweets. What does he have to do, shoot somebody?"I am sad and ashamed."Delayed gratification. Give a man a fish and he eats for a day. Teach him to fish and he eats for a lifetime. Even if one accepts every one of trump's present-day economic arguments, he has failed to recognize what the economy will be like tomorrow, in 10 years, in 50 years. Every other nation on earth is trying to move away from fossil fuels, especially China. Thus mr. trump has simultaneously opened both an economic and a diplomatic door to China. Maybe the 21st century will be the century of China, with America becoming just another former great power.PS, America. Europe is already moving to tax goods based on their carbon footprint, and I'm sure that the WTO will agree with the policy. In other words, if the USA economy remains high carbon, then all American exports to the rest of the world are going to be more heavily taxed by every other nation on the planet. Which will destroy the American economy. Just sayin'.""â€œThe further into the global warming area we go, the more physics and politics narrows our possible paths of action. Hereâ€™s a very cogent and well-argued account of one of the remaining possibilities.â€ Bill McKibben wrote these words on May 17, 2011 in response to my invitation to write the foreword to Verhagen 2012 ""The Tierra Solution: Resolving the climate crisis through monetary transformation"". During this momentous mistake by the Trump Administration Bill again is pointing to the role of science and the importance of diplomacy which in last instance were violated by emir Trump endangering civilization.Perhaps the time has come to seriously study the basic approach of using the unjust, unsustainable and, therefore, unstable international monetary system in service of avoiding the looming climate catastrophe by the pursuit of monetary standard of a specific tonnage of CO2e per person and a balance of payments system that would account for both financial and ecological (climate) debts and credits. The conceptual, institutional, ethical and strategic dimensions are presented in the above book and updated at ""http://www.timun.net"" title=""www.timun.net"" www.timun.net.""Does Trump believe the world will flock to buy our products made with dirty energy when they are making them without it. No body will be buying products from the USA made with dirty energy. Sanctions work - especially when there is massive support for them.Roll on the good times for China, Europe and India.""Just in case the President's utterly defiant and globally disastrous--literally!--act of ecocide ignites a worldwide climate action resistance, is there any chance that Bill McKibben would run in 2020?""If President Barack Obama had not signed on to the Paris Accord, the sociopath, Donald Trump, would be telling his deluded base that he not only composed the entire document, but that it would be the most tremendous agreement ever made in the history of mankind. He would then change its name to the ""Trump Accord"", while claiming to singlehandedly save the earth from the ""bad"" people who believe he is deranged and should be removed from office ASAP.""Democrats stayed home, Trump didn't."Did you really expect more from Trump and this administration?"Excellent and thoughtful article. If only Trump would just grow up and recognize the disaster that these policies will create here and for the whole world. Our hope lies in three things;opposition to an incompetent and dangerous demagogue, a free and inquiring press, and the continual climate saving actions in some states and by some corporations and citizens. It would be helpful to elect better educated and informed representatives to replace the Republican reactionaries.""Trumpâ€™s legacy for America is storms, floods, smog, and contamination.Send the wretched residents of coal country back into the mines. Let them blacken their lungs without concern for the health care and retirement benefits the Republicans will deny them. Let their streams and lakes be clogged with tailings dumped by mining companies, and their groundwater be contaminated by the relentless fracking of oil companies.Enlightened communities will continue to pursue the goal of clean air and water, and a brighter future for the entire planet. And, we will paralyze the filth industries with a glut of class-action lawsuits.""President cited many statistics. I was struck by the coal related numbers. Which countries can open new coal plants and so on. I haven't seen a repudiation of his stats. Simply calling Trump names is not productive. I don't know why the Times wastes space with columns like this one. Get a reasonable, knowledgeable businessperson to submit thoughts. The professor can spend more time in his classroom or building that safe place Wall.""When you thought it could not get worse, it did.""Bill is mistaken.

Then, to top it off, in 2008, Obama became president and again in 2012, defeating Mitt Romney. A President who promoted renewable energy and stayed abreast with new technology.Now that Donald Trump is President, he must demolish as quickly as possible, everything President Obama created and stood for - destroy the man he could never begin to be."The Republican party has now become the only group of people on the planet who fail to recognize the veracity of the science behind man made climate change. Republicans will have to carry the burden of this foolishness for generations. What did we do as a country to foster this ignorance and what awful thing will they do next? Maybe start another gratuitous war? Bring on another financial crisis by unleashing the big banks? Strip medical care from millions in order to profit a few? Stay tuned."Obviously, Trump doesn't love his children too.""Trump does not have the capacity to effectively lead this country. Hence it is well beyond his capacity to be an effective world leader. So we diss NATO, and withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord. What other positions as a world leader will the USA relinquish due to incompetence in the White House?"Thank you Bill McKibben.Why scientists do not need consensus on GRAVITY? Ask yourself that question as you perpetuate the RELIGION of climate change.If there were a world flag it would be flying at half mast today."For several decades now, the Red States, particularly in the south,have strongly advocated for states' rights'. They have generally done this to get around Title VII, Title IX and minimum wage laws imposed by the feds. Now we see Blue States, without screaming states' rights that are pushing back hard at Trump. Yesterday's announcement that California, New York and my home state of Washington were forming an alliance to move forward to meet the Paris Climate Agreement goals, demonstrated the embodiment of states' rights in the most natural form. They also invited other like-thinking states to join them in this goal. This direct push back against a federal government so actively engaged in either discriminatory practices (the Muslim Ban) or the environment, shapes states' rights in a whole new framework. It is a progressive activism that may just change the trajectory of this alt-right movement. This is just the beginning of Trump's reign of ignorance. There will be many more rallying cry moments for this type of activism moving forward.""Stupid and reckless, now just add crude and you have a perfect summing up of Trump's character.Not even six months on the job and you could make a strong case that he is the worst President in American history.Certainly he has already established himself as the worst person ever to become President.If this is winning, I'm very tired of it.""Living on the border in Canada, by the Great Lakes, I wonder how Trump's environmental policies will affect my life. Will he allow dumping into our water supplies? Will he allow our air to be polluted? Thank goodness. The border is New York, which has very courageously said it will honour the accord. I applaud your opinion and hope that this issue continues and does not get lost in campaign rhetoric.""Trump thinks he's smart, but he's the dumbest thing on earth right now - and he's got some competition (Assad, Kim Jong Un). With this he has taken his ignorance and pride and ugliness to new heights.Reality is real. The planet doesn't have a do-over. It will survive, us, not so much. Here are some instructive superb short videos on the subject:""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8d_JvMpoY4&amp;list=PL5WqtuU6JrnXjsGO4WUpJuSVmlDcEgEYb"" title=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8d_JvMpoY4&amp;list=PL5WqtuU6JrnXjsGO4WUpJuSVmlDcEgEYb"" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8d_JvMpoY4&amp;amp;list=PL5WqtuU6JrnXjsGO4W...""Trump's explanation for exiting the Paris Agreement made no sense, but neither did the Agreement itself. While selfishness is not the sole driver of human behavior, neither is the motivation to take on climate change. I read the Paris Accords. It contains a ton of carefully written optimistic language about what countries SHOULD do. There is nothing serious about what happens when they don't. Why should we expect 200+ countries to follow through? Even with punishments, all countries are subjected to political winds regularly. Many will change their minds for any number of reasons, not least because of economic pressures, and certainly well before the year 2030 when the goals are supposed to be reached. The Accord de Paris was all happy talk that is getting more coverage now than when it was signed."McKibben bears some responsibility for leading college students to spend time and emotional energy on fossil fuel divestment rather than electoral politics. A pied piper who should have known better.I adore this president. My next hope is that our great president will depart NATO and the UN."The Green Fund: Trump made it sound like the Green Fund transfers money to undeveloped countries. I appears to be nothing more than a pledge to figure out how to set up a Fund of some $100 billion a year which will be lead by the developing countries. As usual he simply lies.l:""http://www.climatefocus.com/sites/default/files/GCF%20and%20Paris%20Brief%202016.new_.pdf"" title=""http://www.climatefocus.com/sites/default/files/GCF%20and%20Paris%20Brief%202016.new_.pdf"" http://www.climatefocus.com/sites/default/files/GCF%20and%20Paris%20Brie...""Yes it is stupid. But read what McKibben also says about our Canadian PM. Trudeau is just as stupid and reckless, and yet so many think he is some kind of climate action hero, including the editors over at the NYT.See: ""http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trudeau-no-country-would-find-173-billion-barrels-of-oil-in-the-ground-and-leave-them-there-1.4019321"" title=""http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trudeau-no-country-would-find-173-billion-barrels-of-oil-in-the-ground-and-leave-them-there-1.4019321"" http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trudeau-no-country-would-find-173-billion-b...And: ""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/17/stop-swooning-justin-trudeau-man-disaster-planet"" title=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/17/stop-swooning-justin-trudeau-man-disaster-planet"" https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/17/stop-swooning-just...""I am delighted that our fine president has extracted us from another stifling international consortium designed to abridge our national sovereignty. If only now he will abandon NATO and the UN he will be remembered as our greatest president, if not our only great president."It is important to remember the GOP has been anti-environment since Reagan was president. Trump's decision to exit the Paris climate accords is a GOP decision backed by fossil fuel company campaign contributions and an ideology that government should have no role in regulation industry."Stop these silly ideas that central planning has ever worked. The objective truth is that the only hope for the planet is once again the U.S. We must combine our talent with our financial institutions that will invest in it to come up with solutions. Its a shame, but no other country has this combination of talent and investment. Better solar, better batteries, better wind, better processes, better electronics, better sources, these are the solutions.Honestly, the world should have stepped back and let the U.S. to do its best to solve this huge problem. Send any talent here (sure, there is a lot in other countries but they are hobbled by lack of investment). Send money here. They should never have tried to cripple us with these economic sanctions. The Accord worked a world where no one would have the resources, drive and entrepreneurial nature to solve the problems. Trump may have saved the world Mr. McKibben. Let's hope so and get to work.""I've been seeing this portrayed as a controversial topic or a debate. There's no controversy, no debate. The earth is flat, gravity exists, and human activity is changing the climate, with awful consequences.""This decision to pull out is even more troubling given that trump will not release his tax returns. Does he stand to make a financial killing as a result of this action?He was quick to condemn a comedian who crossed the line with her humor invoking the name of his son as being hurt by what he saw. Well, what's Barron's future going to look like in 20 years? In 60 years, when he turns the age trump is now?Without personal health, all the wealth in the world isn't nearly enough. The same may be said for the health of the planet.""""Heâ€™s simply insisting that physics isnâ€™t real.""Stop this overwrought nonsense. ""He"" is saying no such thing. The physics of the atmosphere are complex, with poorly understood feed backs like clouds, and poorly understood effects like aerosols and indirect solar. In the lowest troposphere the atmosphere is already close to saturation for CO2 (please no amateurish counterpoints to ""band widening"" which I already understand). That doesn't mean more CO2 doesn't cause more warming, but it's not by the simple mechanism envisioned by Svante Arrhenius.The truth is that the science is not settled, as to how much of the current warming is man-made, the net future warming, or the effects of that warming. The repetitive references to a non-existent consensus (as if consensus determines scientific certainty anyway), are damaging in the long term to the trust the public puts in science."If you didn't realize it before it is glaring now. Trump is not a leader. He is isolating our country. He is acting in a defensive manner that actually is similar to how Russia acts when they want to belligerently assert themselves. If Trump was going to pick a fight this one was a dumb one that carries enormous symbolism. The Climate accord is a significant achievement of consensus for the entire globe. Trump's move was the move of an incredibly insecure leader."The deision is neither stupid nor reckless. Trump is clearly thinking about his own immediate interests, and not about vision or leadership. The decision to pull out is, evidently, an easy distraction from the relentless Russia issues. It appeases his lobbyists, and plays directly into the narrative of his base, and his party. And he does not personally lose anything by opting out. This is not about Science or the future - it is old-fashioned politics. On this issue, I will wager, Trump has more support from his constituents than on the Russia interference or Healthcare.""And the stupidity and arrogance of Trump and his ilk continues. I hope that every supporter of this disaster gets hit financially and/or at the polls in 2018. Meantime, I'm proud of our states and cities who are going to ignore this horrid decision and continue to work hard to save our beautiful and fragile planet. Yesterday, I never felt so proud at being a Californian!""So much shame and anger for this president and the Republican Party.We fail to do the good thing out of spite, out of selfishness.Other nations can provide healthcare but we can't -it will hurt the economy.Other nations adhere to the Paris Accords but we can't - it will hurt the economy.We seem to be such a fragile people. Everything affects our economy.Where other nations take the courageous steps to do the right things we shirk our duties.On gun control, healthcare and now climate change we are abject failures and cowards.It isn't just a broken political process. We have become a nation of severely challenged people, mentally and spiritually.The ignorant and the craven are in control and the virtuous can only shake their heads in disbelief.""An agreement between the United States and 198 other countries is a de facto treaty irrespective of what other euphemism is attached to it. The ""stupid and reckless"" decision was not submitting it to the Senate, ""oil soaked"" or otherwise, for ratification and de jure treaty status in the first place rather than the politically caculated and short-sighted use of an executive order subject to being overturned at the whim of any future president. Given the apparent support in most States it should have passed. If not, well that's constitutional democracy.""The former head of the USA Hurricane Center is Dr. Neil Frank. He believes,as do many others, that climate change is caused by sun spot activity. Goingback to historical reoords, Dr. Frank makes a strong case. The cities in whichthe atmosphere is polluted, such as Beijing, certainly should do what they can to eliminate smog, for the sake of the inhabitants. However, arbitrary cuts in the use of energy will have no significant effect on climate change. The bureaucrats in Washington and Brussels have not yet discovered how to control the sum.""There is no such thing as ""clean"" fossil fuel. All hydrocarbons burn ""dirty"". The fracking process and transport leave dirty, unusable water, consumed directly by people and indirectly through consumption of tainted agricultural products, pumps poisonous gasses into the air, and creates huge tainted waste water and dangerous chemical disposal problems. Trump's ""recklessness"" time and time again must be impeachable.""Majority of US companies and states ignore Mr. Trump and follow the road to less pollution. Same here in Europe, where Mr. Trump's escapades seem to strenghten th EU as well as the climate pact. So, instead of causing confusion it looks as he will be the big loser hitting walls when he will try to renegotiate things.""Does the United States even have a State Department any more? Where is Secretary Tilerson? Why does he never speak publicly? In light of this momentous and horrendous decision, sure now would be the time to step up and say SOMETHING regarding America's commitment to doing what it can to ease the strain on the environment. His silence is deafening and deepens the leadership void spearheaded by Trump.""I think what everyone needs to understand about him is that he is extremely and permanently angry and he is taking whatever action he thinks will hurt or upset his enemies. His enemies are all the people who didn't vote for him and all Democrats. In every action he takes, he only asks himself: ""Will this make them mad?"" If so, he does it. It's as simple as that. (I had a father just like him.)""President Trump's decision to exit the Paris Accords was the right one. It was right because it puts America first, where it belongs. For too long America has kowtowed to the internationalists. Under Trump that will stop. Now its time for America First. We need to think about Americans, we need to think about jobs (jobs for real Americans); jobs that will pay enough to raise families not continue to live at home with the parents. Also America does not need to pay billions of dollars to other countries in the name of climate control. That money will go into some corrupt bureaucrat's pocket, just like all the money the USA sends to Afghanistan and Iraq to fight terrorism. What a waste! Yes, I am for America First. Internationalism last. I support Trump. Thank you.""Behold the power of propaganda, a toolkit sharpened in the defense of the argument that TOBACCO isn't unhealthy.Having practiced their arts for decades in that battle, the same sham scientists and bribed researchers set about manufacturing doubt about the science where there should be none and skepticism about ironclad evidence that the planet is ALREADY warming noticeably. Earlier planting seasons and spring break-ups, the retreat of previously stable alpine glaciers, and the rising of the seas are pretty much impossible to disprove.But they've managed, in a stunning victory of PR over truth to persuade people to believe the shoddiest arguments and junk science over peer reviewed and carefully researched results.America is now too stupid to lead the world and too irresponsible for anyone to trust us, and THAT legacy will haunt the Republican Party and the United States for many decades.""Trump is the biggest threat to the economy, our nation, and world stability. Our 50 unites states need to step up, turn their backs toward Washington D.C., and take lead of their own economic futures and the direction of our planet earth. 50 to 1. Iâ€™ll take those odds. And just because Washington is dysfunctional, ignorant, and nationalistic, doesn't mean our states should blindly follow to the beat of Trumpâ€™s inane stream of unintelligible thought. God, if we could only stop thinking about ourselves and look at the world as one family, Trumpâ€™s excluded.""Trump is the biggest threat to our economy, our nation, and world stability.

Can't you get them to say in a public forum that the US cannot be Number 1 on climate change denial, that we have to act on the current consensus science and continue to monitor? Then, publish the list of names, companies of those who refused your first request and their first response (so they incentive to evolve their position).If company CEO's cannot tell us exactly why they refuse to endorse erring on the safe side, what chance is there of getting the common man to endorse erring on the safe side?The sooner that we can get corporate leaders to endorse the Paris Accords as prudent action, the sooner that this war with the ""make me believe"" masses can be avoided. Trumpzilla must be isolated on Deniers' Island.""Last night's TV weather report in the Philly area: 'What can NYC/NJ do to prevent the next Hurricane Sandy?' with lots of shots of the devastation of the last big one. Shots of people sobbing and digging through the debris on their beach properties? The short answer, particularly in light of Trump's latest.... move. Maybe insurance premiums need to become more expensive than the worst healthcare plan before people will start realizing that the seas will be taking back what's theirs in the coming decade. No, the Paris Accord would not have prevented hurricanes- but it would have gone a long way toward slowing the ever faster devolution of our planet and would likely have encouraged shared R&amp;D worldwide. And that's just the issue of rising seas. If anyone needs to understand why China will lead the way, take a look at the pollution in Beijing, choking on unsustainable air pollution. Now look at CA success story on that same issue. But hey, you'd have to believe in science to understand what's changed.""""Dutch Railroader"" has it right. In Trump's narrow mind, anything with President Obama's name on it is anathema. Trump is vengeance-oriented, an essential element of hubristic pride. How DARE President Obama campaign against him? How DARE President Obama make a joke of him - the mainlining ""birther"" - at a White House Correspondents' Dinner??So, it doesn't matter if anything is good or bad for America, or even the Republican party. If it's an achievement of President Obama, it's got to go. What a petty, petty man; and ultimately, dangerous. Those of us old enough to remember the outrageous excesses of a head of state whose sole orientation is ""self"" are, and should be, alarmed. But we can thank our respective dieties that our forefathers crafted a body of laws - our Constitution - that protect us from demagoguery run wild. The Electoral system they designed resulted in a grotesque distortion last November, but other elements of their design will ultimately protect us from... Trump.""I think he is wrong but the degree of hysteria generated is somewhere between ridiculous and nauseating. The world will not end and the Pacific will not boil. As in another piece today it is clear that many so called progressives are pining for a system like the old Soviet Union, where only Correct Thought is permitted. The USA is well on the way to becoming an intellectually bankrupt country, and that is only to a minor extent due to Trump.""Nonsense. Why didn't Obama submit the Paris Agreement to the Senate? Because it would not be ratified by the U.S. Senate. It was a bad deal. The U.S. had to provide most of the resources, and make most of the reductions. A bad deal.""President Snow has done it again. He has proven that he is a heartless, stupid, monster. Now with that rant out of the way, I am ever so grateful that Trump keeps going from bad to worse, to much worse, to exceedingly worse, to rotten to the core. Oh dear I am ranting again. What I meant to say is that no matter how stupid the GOP leadership, Republicans as a whole are not stupid. I predict they will soon call for Trump's impeachment. He is definitely a threat to democracy here and around the world. Spreading democracy through example is our sacred mission. We can't do that if led by a ruthless dictator."How do we get rid of the Electoral College. We have had two Presidents put into office in this manner and both have been a disaster to the U.S.Obama finally managed to raise our status with the world leaders after the Bush Presidency and Trump has managed to kill our reputation in a little over 4 months.It is time to change the way Presidents get into office through the Electoral College."Possibly, when all of Donald Trump's seaside properties are underwater, he will recognize and be willing to address climate change. More likely that he will blame it on Democrats and rant about his shady election. The unfortunate outcome of this is, we will all suffer, not just the fools who support this travesty. Shame on Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan and all the congressman who have sold their souls to the Koch Brothers.""Authoritarian regimes like the old USSR and China adopt historical amnesia to obliterate records of the current leader's predecessors. Trump's primary motive in withdrawing from the Paris Accord -- like his insistance on repealing the ACA and the destruction of the rest of the Obama legacy -- is the banishment of any reference to Barack Obama. If there was any doubt that Trump seeks absolute power, this removes it.""Only in coal dependent West Virginia will Donald find a wholly receptive audience to his rejection of the Paris Accords. Nearly everywhere else the response is dubious to downright hostile. It was a politically stupid move. Never mind if global warming is real or imaginary, this was stupid. Numerous heads of corporations with global interests, the best scientific minds, even his own daughter urged Donald not to vacate the Paris Accords. To no avail. Forget you all, says Donald. So why is he committing political suicide? It isn't integrity, Donald has never displayed integrity before. No doubt the Presidency isn't the joyride Donald imagined it to be. It could be that Donald is sick of the job, the leaks, etc. and wants out. He'll do just what he wants, even if it's politically foolish, while he looks for a way to resign and then let Mike Pence have this mess. Good for him and good for us. Donald can retire to Mar-A-Lago and tell himself that America and the World didn't appreciate his greatness. There he can watch as the rising tides start to spill over onto the fairways and the cart paths.""Interesting that Trump, the big tough guy, didn't have the guts to tell the EU and the G-7 what he intended to do. Instead he demurred because waffling was easier than straight talk.""Why does this not surprise me ? Trump is a 5 year child trapped ina 70 year old body. This is an example where Trump's stubborn arrogance shines. Watching him speak in the Rose Garden he reminds me of a 5 year old who has just told his parents off. I cannot understand how the fervent Trump supporters believe that his actions regarding the Paris Accords &amp; other decisions is to their benefit. There is still some time for us to manage and deal with the effects of global warming. In another fewdecades it will be too late. The problems of disease and mass migrationsof people as try to escape the environmental devastation will overwhelmthe ability of governments to handle such matters. I am glad that the newlyelected French POTUS has invited American scientists to come to hisnation and continue their work. The nationalistic fever espoused byTrump, Bannon et al will be our nations ruin. This year marks the 100 anniversary of JFKs birth. He came into office a junior rated senator and ended up as a first rate leader. His leadership during the Cuban Missile Crisis prevented a nuclear horror from occurring. Trump has come into office as an incompetent businessman and will exit as the worst POTUS in modern times beating out Harding, Hoover, Nixon and Bush 43. Trump hasaccomplished something I never thought possible. He has begun to turnour nation from a leadership role into a backward third rate nation.""Relax, tRump is ushering himself to the sidelines while others do the leading. It will take several years to implement this, and our new president (be it 2020 or sooner) will nullify tRump's order.The dishonorable and mentally unsound President Pumpkin will turn out to be a tempest in a teapot.""Will states now be &gt;compelled&lt; to follow the less stringent or rolled back Federal emissions and efficiency regulations? e.g. California will be penalized for it's auto-emissions standard, which, because of the size of its market is almost a defacto standard anyway? Do the Repubs really think that such stupidity will be a competitive advantage in the both the U.S. and global market place? Don't they know that companies build EnergyStar appliances because people want to buy them?!? Think about that early executive order that again allows coal companies to dump waste into rivers. Who's going to do that? For what purpose?And what about their reverence for states rights? Guess it only applies when it comes to regulating reproductive rights....""When we consider that Trump is not alone, that so many powerful people in this country, the US Chamber of Commerce and so many think tanks and lobbyists financed by rich industrialists -- people that WE have allowed to accumulate such power -- agree with him, the conclusion is perfectly clear. Some of us know better, but in sum the human species is too stupid to survive.""I think the world will start abandoning ties with the US. They will start replacing US imports, replacing reliance on US military, reducing and eliminating any US dominance in the world. The US will see a significant impact in the next year. It will affect their economy in negative ways. America will be the forgotten as the world moves forward without them.""The best thing that could be said about this never-ratified, non-binding, treaty was that it was better than nothing. Losing it is an appropriate occasion for anger at Trump's relentless anti-governmentalism. Concern for the environment ... not so much.""Hopefully, yesterday showed some Americans that we are paying a high price for ignorance and possible collusion with Russia. Fear, ignorance, bias, racism, and misplaced faith put Trump in office. Those qualities were enhanced by hacking, fake news, and several forms of interference in our election. Other voters were bedazzled by third party candidates and private email servers. Many others just stayed home. Those forces brought us, among other bad decisions, what we saw yesterday in the Rose Garden. Right now, the uneducated, unsophisticated, and uncaring rule our government and much of our country. A vocal white minority got major help from a foreign power to put their guy in the White House. I hope we are learning the stark lesson that elections do matter. Here's hoping we can do a better job in 2018.""Despite the fact that we lecture the World on Democracy and believe that our system of Government is the best bar none, we neglect to recognize that Democracy can only work if there exists an infrastructure to support it. That infrastructure is an informed and enlightened populace. Without it, not only Democracy fails to deliver, it becomes self-destructive. Ignorant people elect ignorant Leaders and ignorant Leaders destroy the Country. Enter one Donald J. Trump whom undoubtedly can be crowned as the most ignorant Leader that this Nation has had since its birth. Hence 62 million ignorant people using Democracy to ligitimately destroy this country if not the whole World.""Here is the scariest part. He has no moral authority. He has no chance of being a pioneering or inspiring leader. He is left with only his commander-in-chief power. Having lost all his other potential powers, he will become more inclined to turn to his military power. That is truly frightening because he is such a megalomaniac.""The saddest part of our refusal to deal with climate change is that our nation will cause others to suffer first and most. Poorer countries will suffer from tsunamis, mudslides, pollution, etc. and millions will die while the US and its citizens drive SUVs and fly to Mexico for annual vacations. Our gold-plated president has just highlighted the enormous unfairness of this grave situation, that others will have to deal with our shortsighted and selfish failure to act.""It's my understanding that Nicaragua didn't join the agreement, not because it denied climate change, but because it didn't require the wealthy, most polluting nations to assist developing countries more as the world transitions to a lower carbon setting. Per capita, the US citizens probably account for 30 - 40 times more CO2 than Nicaraguans. I guess poor countries resent the wealthy nations pulling up the ladder to prosperity after they stunk up the place."I have to think that Trump has been promised full campaign funding for 2020 by coal and oil interests. Alongside his angry desire to destroy everything Obama"This may be about money and drilling in Russia's Arctic but Donald Trump's cover is always that his actions are for the people. The people of Pittsburgh not Paris. Presumably the people --or cretins--who voted Donald Trump in want this country broken and remade in the image of its ugly past--rife with racism, pollution, and an immigrants-out mentality. Such is the ambition of these people. To serve them we must destroy every inch of progress we have made. The point is to be anti science, rationality, diplomacy, decency, ethical. The point is to go back in time to some mythical era of white working class rule when the elites and all their stupid ideas of progress had no currency. Meanwhile Trump and his cohorts can stuff their pockets with backchannel money.""The Paris Climate accord wasn't worth anything in the hands of the Republicans anyway. It's not binding, ok? If it were, do you think the Senate had ratified it? This is just a PR desaster, nothing else. Now, the Orange One and his allies have a couple of months to translate that into jobs for Flyoverstan or big House wins could translate into impeachment over collusion with a foreign adversary or the emoluments clause. ""Could"" if the Dems were to run a bit of a campaign of their own instead of just running against Trump.""while this poor excise of a leader is just the most recent (and egregious) example of the gop's ""vision"" for our (once) great nation, let's not forget the contributions to our current situation from yet another beacon of enlightened intelligence, good 'ol W and his decision to exit the kyoto treaty. yes, this party and its leaders firmly believe in nothing but enriching themselves at the expense of virtually everyone else by simply refusing to believe in proven science. maybe the right has a point... our education system truly is broken to have such people lead our country. #sad!"Trump just wants the little people to know who's boss.And he's hoping to make a few bucks on the deal.As a New Zealander I think we should start charging Americans to visit our country and breathe our fresh air.You're really getting a bad name for yourself now America. I wouldn't visit the States and I want to! Many others I talk with here feel the same way. Not with Trump in power.How long before tourism figures come out showing a massive drop in tourists to the US?"We don[t need the agreements of governments in order to solve the global warming problem. What we need ot do is to have a lot few babies, and let the human population decline to a fraction of what it is now. The populations in most western countries would already be in decline - putting a serious brake on greenhouse gas emissions - were it not for immigration.""Our political system is not working, if this man can remain President of this country.""Let's all just get over it. The shock and outrage are duly noted. You'd have to be blind not to have seen this one coming. Let this be a call to action on the local and state levels. The big hoax -- not global warming but our president -- has given us enough cause to rise above this decision and take a stand. Trump's tough talk about renegotiating a deal or making this work for America plays to his poor, desperate base. I truly pity them. I don't blame them. They were hurting and the hurt was real. But in a couple of years the pain will be excruciating and the Royal Family will be counting their new wealth, earned or stolen off the backs of people who put faith in this ill-informed, ignorant charlatan.""Robert Reich has perfectly expressed my feelings toward all the countries who signed and still honor the Paris Climate Accord - the countries Donald Trump thumbs his nose at with his trademark ignorant swagger. Reich says it far more politely than I have the heart to:""A short message to the rest of the world:We apologize. We understand our responsibilities as human beings who share this planet with you. This is temporary. Donald Trump doesnâ€™t reflect the views of most Americans. Most of us didnâ€™t even vote for him. We are doing everything we possibly can to remove him from office as soon as legally possible. And when we do, America will once again be a responsible nation."""I guess it was a bit much to expect a reality television star to understand science."Shame on us. The only way we can recover our leadership role as a country, and repudiate this black mark on our reputation, is to toss these men out of office. Perhaps this is how the Abolishonists felt, fueled by their morale authority and righteous anger towards slavery. We now feel this way about Climate Change, and not because we have seen a moral truth that the others don't see, but because we see, via the lens of science, what is right in front of us, while these men are blind.""I believe in listening people who are smarter than I am, not stupider than I am.Trump is way far stupider than I am. I can turn him off without a second thought. Reading Bannon's plotting for winning another term, after what we've seen only four months into trump's first term, makes me angry and sick. I have children and grandchildren. I want them to have as safe a world as can be provided. Trump's sticking his head in the sand totally disregards the evidence we have seen and which has been described and explained to us. And here this ignoramus, who truly has nothing to give this country and wants only to shove us all around and steal whatever isn't nailed down, has already put us in jeopardy and is planning to finish us all up with a second term.God help us."I apologized to my child the day after the election for failing to do more to stop trump from winning. I had no idea how much I was apologizing for"Our Leader Leads Us into DarknessIn the Rose Garden he told usabout sovereignty on a dying planet,about freedom crafted in a prisonfor our children, promised jobsin the mine, proclaimed a lifeof soot, fire, fear, and hiding,then paused for applause.In that silence I heard ourgreat resolve, that this leaderhas no interest in the unitedUnited States, but only in hisdwindling band of hopeful poorwe must save from his short view."Could Trump be indicted for crime against humanity in rejecting this treaty when we think about the catastrophic consequences of his act jeopardizing the life of millions of people on the planet.Trump is a selfish paranoid man. How sad for him that he believes everything that everybody does is totally motivated by self interest. Following this view to the Russian involvement investigations and follow the trump investors and you will come full circle. Trump may have enormous exposure to Russian interests banks etc. Everyman for themselves according to trump."When did so many wealthy people who support the GOP - D.T's actions no less - become so unable to read, and listen to environmentalists, and simply observe - see - what is taking place in many communities and around the planet. Has greed blinded them to our situation?""Bill McKibbon makes good arguments...as he has done for years. What are the counter arguments? There are none. None that hold water, that is.The problem is, good arguments work only on rational people. You can't reason someone out of a position they didn't reason themselves into, the old adage goes.And, unfortunately, Republicans haven't ""done reason"" since Ronald Reagan. When they decided to bring the the Tea Party, the Palinistas, the Evangelicals, and the Trumpistas into the fold; and when they decided to rely on Fox and Friends and Facebook for their ""news"", reason pretty much went out the window.""""But the hope of Paris was that the treaty""...Hmm...not a treaty eh? You see, for the US to enter into a treaty it takes 2/3 vote of approval of the US Senate, which Obama never got. Thus, the agreement can be rescinded as easy as it was put in place, stroke of a pen. In the future, globalist Progressives might want to keep that in mind. Sidestepping treaty requirements to push something through, leaves you with very little in the end. Putting that to the side, the Paris Accord (Treaty) supporters are talking out of both sides of their mouths. On the one hand, they are saying we had no reason to pull out of the deal because it is not legally binding on the US to do much of anything, yet in the next sentence they say it's a disaster for the climate for the US to leave the agreement. Well which one is it?The truth is the United States was going to be on the hook for massive expenses under the agreement that would flow to corporations and governments around the world. The corporations you see supporting it today, they get government money from the accord, as for all the countries supporting it today, many of them get money for being in it. Most of that money is paid by the United States out of American taxpayers' pockets. It was a massive redistribution of wealth from middle income Americans to the rest of the world. It was a bad deal for the US that Obama got us into without getting the necessary Senate approval. End of story.""It is hard to describe in one sentence the world's disappointment following President Trump's decision to listen to both Stephen Bannon his ""political advisor"" and outlier EPA chief Scott PruittÂ and to see Trump'sÂ inability to fathomÂ immense consequences.""Trump shares his authoritarian reach with Poland, Hungary and Turkey, climate denying states all even they have not pulled out Paris Accord as they two of the three are in EU. THEIR MESSAGE; GET USED TO A SHORT SUFFERING LIFE. Survival of the fittest. You choose the coal mines. We ill help you to your stubborn death. A deadly slight of hand in the name of the people.""Mr Trump is not alone and as noted twenty-two Senators along with more in the House who support this latest absurdity should have their names emblazoned in lights. Unfortunate that many among us can't read let alone think.A depression era sign photographed by Diane Arbus read:""This is your country don't let the big men take it away from you""""I hope that all Americans are now aware of what and who this President is, not only irresponsible and reckless, but completely ignorant of everything around him. He is incompetent and inexperienced, and if his colleagues in Congress do not stop him, he will set back the USA for many years and cause tremendous damage and suffering. Our only hope is that he opts to resign and go back to his business.""It is stupid and reckless to be close minded to Trump's Climate change decision. Trump (T) has been in office for less than 5 months, how has he or his policies contributed to climate change? 7 out of the top 10 most polluted cities, by year round short-term and long term particle pollution and ozone in the USA are in CA. It is the mess that T inherited and is trying to deal with that mess in his own way. Charity should begin at home and states should be held responsible for keeping their air, water and land clean and big govt, throwing money at problems and policing the world and signing accords will put US in deeper debt and will do diddle squat to prevent climate change. People instead around the world should protest polluting industries and shut them down. Stop driving gas guzzlers and trucks to haul goods. Encourage use of solar energy, electricity generated without polluting the environment. Ask not what the US can do to keep your environment clean ask what you can do yourself to ensure your micro environment remains clean. Let us give T a chance to find solutions different from the Paris accord to prevent climate change and if his experiment fails, 2020 will be your opportunity to prevent reelection of T. Until that time let the chips fall where they may. Stock market is rising to record levels, private hiring has reached new records, there are more jobs than there are Americans to fill jobs, 1/2 of US is in mourning and 1/2 is either just surviving or thriving."Elections have consequences. Resist away for the next 7 1/2 years. The wall is next."With every action Trump takes to undo Obama's legacy, respect and admiration for Obama rises not only in the US but all around the world. Trump is raising Obama to new heights."Like a bizarre and isolated Nero he tweets while the world slowly burns."A total and complete disgrace. Well Putin again got what he wanted. Defrost Russia to drill for oil, dominate the energy market, and knock the US down a few pegs on the world stage, No Longer seen as a World Leader.""Trump ends the ""war on coal""! ...And eight track tapes, floppy disks and 35mm film! Stupid, unconscionable move, but ultimately the people will prevail.""it is a great tragedy that those with the intelligence, the wisdom and willingness to forgo personal profit for the greater good so seldom find themselves in positions of power, especialliy in politics. this conumdrum was central to Aristotelian ethics, yet we still seem to be stuck with selfish, stupid and power-hungry heads of state. in Finnish we have a saying: it's no good asking with a ladle when it was meted out with a spoon...(a person's intelligence)"Congress isn't exempt here: they've been sitting on their hands now for over 8 years."There's only one solution to this problem: remove the hammer, remove the smasher and his cronies in forthcoming elections. And spread the word to Trump voters that the future--for Pittsburg and everyone else--is green. Jobs, energy, money: they're all flow to renewable energy.""george carlin:""Did you ever think about the arithmetic?"" he goes on. ""The planet has been here 4-1/2 billion years. We've been here, what, 100,000, maybe 200,000? And we've only been engaged in heavy industry for a little over 200 years. Two hundred years vs. 4-1/2 billion. And we have the conceit to think that somehow we are a threat? That somehow we are gonna put in jeopardy this beautiful little green ball that's just floating around the sun. The planet has been through a lot worse than us. The planet isn't going anywhere â€” we are.""is trump stupid and reckless on this issue or is bill mckibben the one who is completely wrong?""""Stupid and Reckless"" sums things up quite nicely. Perhaps a few of his supporters will feel somewhat ashamed at this point, but I have to wonder. DT has done more than shoot someone in the center of Times Square - he has taken a very public shot at the earth, and we should all cringe at his stupidity and recklessness. Instead, many of his supporters are cheering him on and posting ""evidence"" from Breitbart. Because as we all know, Breitbart knows a great deal more than 97% of the earth's climate scientists.""It is not only the decision that is stupid and reckless, it the Trump that brazenly embodies those characteristics. He is checking another promise box for his uneducation, narrow-thinking, short-term vision voters who are still drinking his Kool-Aid. Wait until the Kool-Aid is polluted and the air unbreathable - but he will be gone with his plunder. Sa. and very unpatriotic.""Thank goodness we have a president who is serious about saving American sovereignty. This Paris accord is a wealth redistribution scheme. Nothing more, nothing less.""What is the difference between genius and stupidity? Genius has its limits. The Republican President and 22 Republicans in the Senate have proved that stupidity knows no bound.The tragedy is that The Republican President has forfeited American global leadership and created a leadership vacuum that won't last long. China is already stepping up to replace the United Sates. Arrogance, greed, stupidity and spite motivate The Republican President and his Republican Administration but those qualities are not a foundation for global leadership.""Bill, I don't think you listened to Trump's speech. Note also that he spoke of being open to a new discussion with countries, and a new agreement which did not put America at a disadvantage.Calling someone who disagrees with you stupid and reckless isn't worthy of a Middlebury prof, and doesn't imply that you are willing to discuss facts.The US has been decreasing its greenhouse gas emissions for 30 years or more. Obama's projections seemed unrealistic...and very expensive, for little further gain, if achieved. What say you about the fact that China now each year releases almost twice as much in pollutants as the US?""Scientists agree that projected reductions in carbon emissions produced the Paris Agreement wouldnâ€™t stop and probably wouldnâ€™t significantly slow global warming, even in the unlikely event the parties to the agreement met their reduction goals. And global warming would continue even if manmade emissions were entirely eliminated, abet at a slower pace. The planet always warms between ice ages. Rather than gambling on non-binding and unenforceable, we should explore carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies that reduce the amount of carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere. Wikipedia provides a convenient summary of CDR technologiesâ€”including direct air captureâ€”at ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_removal#Direct_air_capture_.28DAC.29"" title=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_removal#Direct_air_capture_.28DAC.29"" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_removal#Direct_air_capture_...""Just in case, I suggest that President Trump and the people who helped convince him to withdraw from the Paris Agreement write a letter of apology to their future great grandchildren. It could start with something like, ""I'm so, so sorry about the role I played in changing your climate. I thought I was doing what was best for America. I now wish that I had spent the time to learn about the science relating to climate change, but I was just too busy. I deeply regret my part in the loss of lives and the worldwide lowering of lifestyles due to your changing climate. Please forgive me.""""Bill, I doubt that DT said anything about wind and solar not being 24/7 365 but that question will face the governors of California and New York who have said they will continue to move toward all renewable / do not know yet about Vermont.To do that NY, CA, VT should be reviewing going Swedish, Danish, German and more and do as they all do / use readily available renewable fuel to heat and to generate electricity 24/7 365. Since readers and maybe even you will say as US environmental groups do - cannot incinerate, it is dangerous (a long time ago when I knew nothing I was one of those in Rochester NY, then I moved to Sweden and now know something) here is what I suggest.Governors United, those who say they will go renewable, should become united and then send a representative to Denmark, Sweden, Germany to see how important solid-waste incineration is in moving those countries to all renewable. My city, Linkoping, has the newest and most advanced such facility.Why not Vermont?""http://Only-NeverInSweden.blogspot.com"" title=""Only-NeverInSweden.blogspot.com"" Only-NeverInSweden.blogspot.comDual citizen US SE""Finally, we have a President who decides in the best interest of America and Americans. After all, that is the job description of POTUS, is it not? He said he wants to negotiate a climate agreement that is fair for all. Sounds good to me.""The News You Didnâ€™t Hear:Reporters only want to talk about Russia, instead of what Team Trump is getting done.""https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-news-you-didnt-hear-1496358236"" title=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-news-you-didnt-hear-1496358236"" https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-news-you-didnt-hear-1496358236""How will this Accord every actually achieve its goal if its signatories are still so dependent on coal and even plan to increase their usage like India and China? Renewables are not there yet in terms of providing sufficient energy. This is fact. Coal is still heavily used. This is also fact. No country is going to shut down entire industries to comply with this Accord. Germany has already demonstrated this.I'm beginning to understand that this is more a ""mindset"" than an actual achievable set of measurable results. Belonging to this ""club"" is more important than what its members actually achieve. No wonder Trump felt he could reject it. There's not much there beyond an emotional commitment.""Why are trade and climate not combined? We have moved the production of all our goods to China and now India, where they emit much more pollution per dollar of production. A good compromise between what Trump wants to do and environmentalists would be to push our trade with countries like Germany that produce goods efficiently in terms of emissions. Impose tariffs on goods coming into this country based on the other countries carbon emissions/$ produced. It would decrease our trade deficit with China and other inefficient producers and help save the planet.""In his disgraceful announcement in the White house rose garden, #45 said that he was 'elected by Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, not Paris, France.' Another false statement. Pittsburgh, while overridden by voting in the rural areas of the state, voted overwhelmingly for the winner of the popular vote, Hillary Clinton. The citizens in Pittsburgh, home of several world-class universities and medical schools, understand that science and facts are reliable ways to overcome economic and environmental problems. They do not want to return to the environmental disaster that Pittsburgh was during the days before the EPA started the push to make industries like coal and steel responsible for mitigating the damage they were doing to the air, water, and health of their workers. Neither do the rest of us - and so, we will resist.""I don't suppose it's occurred to Trump or his politburo that greatness comes from sharing, cooperating, and doing the right thing when it counts and sometimes when no one is watching. No, the only thing Trump cares about is himself. The country and the planet don't matter. His orbit is so small that what he sees is not even an earth centered system; it's a Trump centered system with everyone and everything else bowing down to him or, if they don't, being banished to the outer rings of his orbit where he fire nasty Tweets.""45's budget proposal reduced funding to the EPA by 40%. NOAA also saw its budget cut by nearly as much threatening to end monitoring and warning of impending tornados in the Southeast US. This action was done in March. In the EPA's mission statement the words ""verifiable science"" were replaced by ""economically achievable"". Yesterday's pullout from the Paris Climate-change Agreement keeps 45 on the same nationalist path. Resistance calls for more than just cities and corporations maintaining current practices to lessen the affects of global warming. Indeed, if ""funds are cut for satellites and ocean buoys that monitor our degrading climate"", then we need to restore those funds by petitioning our Representatives in the House and Senate. 45 has not made America first, but last. He has not made America great again, but the worst. Its time for America's better angels to make our homeland and our planet a better place to live for all.""People's obsession with CO2 is unhealthy, non-scientific, and harmful to the planet.We need a more comprehensive measure of pollution that accounts not only for CO2, but also SO2, NOX, particulates, heavy metals, etc. put into the atmosphere, water, and ground. In fact, it might move beyond just pollution and account for a range of environmental protections (e.g. eco diversity, habitat preservation, etc.)The Yale Index provides a fascinating measure that moves in that direction. ""http://epi.yale.edu/country-rankings"" title=""http://epi.yale.edu/country-rankings"" http://epi.yale.edu/country-rankingsI propose the following action plan:1. Rate every country on a comprehensive environmental index.2. Exported products from any country below a minimum index score can be subjected to a pollution surcharge within the WTO framework.Itâ€™s that simple. Products from Europe, the U.S., Japan, and other developed countries would be unaffected because of our similar environmental regulations (e.g. refer to the Yale Index). But products from China, India, Mexico, and other countries with poor environmental protections could be hit with substantial import duties.Letâ€™s beyond honest. Outsourcing production to developing countries is outsourcing pollution as well.""We all ought to have solar panels in our backyards or on our rooftops. We ought to be selling energy back to the utility companies. We ought to have electric or hybrid cars that we plug up to our own energy sourcesThis would mean jobs for people to make, install, and maintain the panels.""If it is so dangerous to other countries then they will have to step up. Why not restrict everyone to no additions, we will reduce for our share. This was just a way to steal wealth from our country, nothing more.""Climate change became a partisan issue when it became obvious that saying yes to every crazy, dangerous, discredited special interest desire wins votes. The coalition of disgruntled minority factions who rally around deregulation has produced a non-compromising Congress made of political opportunists and a fool in the White House. As the philosopher Eric Hoffer wrote, the political extremes are closer to each other than they are to the middle of the political spectrum. When the extremes coalesce as they have in the US today or Germany in the 30â€™s, bad things happen.""Besides the obvious harm to the environment and all the nations that this decision will cause, Trump has just caused a seismic shift in world politics the past two weeks. Between his actions at the NATO conference last week and this decision, the United States has abdicated its role as the de facto most respected nation in the world. No longer are countries looked up to us as a model. No longer do they respect our leadership on global issues. They are bypassing the US and will look to other countries for leadership. This will have dire consequences as China and others step into the huge vacuum created by Trump's withdrawal from global politics. This is pure insanity on every level. What happens to the US economy when the dollar is replaced as the worlds currency? Never mind the obvious environmental issues which the president adn his coterie appear to be incapable of understanding despite overwhelming evidence, this is a horrible political and business decision that will have much broader negative consequences.""When Obama went for President his slogan was ""Yes, we can!"". The US need to hold up and follow this today even more than every before. And, beside the very positive ""Yes"", the most important word in this phrase is the ""we"", I think. What still gives me hope is the wide range of cities, communities, NGOs and other organizations and business leaders who want to follow the Paris Accord nonetheless. There can be a ""we"" big enough to achieve important goals. And the world will recognice it!"
