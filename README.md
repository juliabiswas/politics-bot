# Politics-bot

Politics-bot is a model created with Keras that trains a bot to form its own political commentary using comments NY Times's Op-Eds from May 2017 (data can be found on Kaggle).

## Installation

To run the notebook (using Google Colab), you need to save the data file to your Google Drive and edit the location in the file (where it is commented). When you run the file, you will be prompted to enter an authorization code (which will open up in another tab). Once you do this, you are done, and the file should run.

## Usage

Forming political commentary.
